Via TNW:
Peter Sunde, one of the founders of Pirate Bay, has launched a crowdsourced funding program to release Heml.is, a messaging service that seeks to evade government monitoring programs by using end-to-end encryption[.]
It&rsquo;ll be free and and open-source when it comes out, with paid add-ons for extra functionality. And before anyone says it&rsquo;s form over function: it needs to be beautiful if there&rsquo;s going to be significant uptake, which is exactly what encrypted communications needs.

I&rsquo;m trying to be more open to the idea that I don&rsquo;t know what I want. It&rsquo;s easy to get swept up and inherit other people&rsquo;s values wholesale; pause for a moment to reflect on what you really want, or how to find that out.
To be mature you have to realize what you value most. It is extraordinary to discover that comparatively few people reach this level of maturity.

I saw Neil Gaiman speak recently. He was as eloquent on stage as you&rsquo;d expect, and an answer to one particular audience question reminded of a New Year Wish of his:
I hope that in this year to come, you make mistakes. Because if you are making mistakes, then you are making new things, trying new things, learning, living, pushing yourself, changing yourself, changing your world. You&rsquo;re doing things you&rsquo;ve never done before, and more importantly, you&rsquo;re Doing Something.

In a previous post of mine, I devoted a couple of paragraphs to summing up the current state of psychological research into happiness. It occurred to me that Eric Weiner&rsquo;s The Geography of Bliss has a much better précis than I did at the time:
Extroverts are happier than introverts; optimists are happier than pessimists; married people are happier than singles, though people with children are no happier than childless couples; Republicans are happier than Democrats; people who attend religious services are happier than those who do not; people with college degrees are happier than those without, though people with advanced degrees are less happy than those with just a BA; people with an active sex life are happier than those without; women and men are equally happy, though women have a wider emotional range; having an affair will make you happy but will not compensate for the massive loss of happiness that you will incur when your spouse finds out and leaves you; people are least happy when they’re commuting to work; busy people are happier than those with too little to do; wealthy people are happier than poor ones, but only slightly.
