<p>The Uber ban is bad news.</p>
<p>I know more than one person with a disability or chronic illness who relies on Uber – to see friends, to get to work, to get to medical appointments. Those people are literally only able to get around using Uber. They lose a lifeline if Uber is gone, as do thousands of drivers.</p>
<p>Uber also saves lives. <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2783797">Research by Dills and Mulholland</a> finds that the rate of vehicle accidents, assaults and public order offences drops considerably when Uber enters a city.</p>
<p>Transport for London could have demanded reforms if it wanted to. Instead, it gave Uber one minute&rsquo;s notice of the decision before going public with it. <a href=https://blog.taxify.eu/2017/09/bringing-fairer-ride-hailing-to-london/>Other companies</a> have tried to bring innovation to London&rsquo;s taxi market and been brought to their knees by TfL&rsquo;s vindictiveness.</p>
<p>To some extent I think their flouting of the rules has been a good thing. I was surprised that the LTDA lost a case against them <a href=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/transport/11935513/uber-minicabs-high-court-ruling-victory-london.html>alleging that Uber uses the driver&rsquo;s mobile phone as a taximeter</a> (which it clearly does!) – but it&rsquo;s totally changed the shape of the market, and I believe for the better.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen plenty of people enjoy watching Uber squirm. I look forward to hearing what they&rsquo;re proposing should fill the gap – but given that nothing similar existed before Uber, it&rsquo;s not clear that anything will.</p>
<hr>
<p>TfL hasn&rsquo;t given out much information on the decision, but they mention:</p>
<ul>
<li>Uber&rsquo;s use of Greyball in London – <a href=http://uk.businessinsider.com/uber-exec-we-didnt-use-greyball-to-evade-uk-regulators-2017-9>an independent review has already found that they didn&rsquo;t use it</a></li>
<li>Uber&rsquo;s approach to DBS checks – which are done by a government-owned company, as part of individuals getting a private hire licence, so not clear what Uber has to do with it</li>
<li>Uber&rsquo;s approach to medical checks – doctors were accepting bribes to give drivers a clean bill of health, but they were <a href=https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/1897962/investigation-reveals-dodgy-gps-getting-cash-to-help-minicab-and-uber-drivers-fake-medical-test-over-fitness-to-drive/>doing the same for other minicab firms</a>, and again I don&rsquo;t see how it&rsquo;s Uber&rsquo;s problem (any more than me going to the doctor and paying for a forged sick note to play hookey)</li>
<li>Uber&rsquo;s approach to reporting criminal offices – which is definitely awful (and far too slow), but there only seems to be a <a href=http://uk.businessinsider.com/met-police-letter-uber-doesnt-report-serious-crimes-2017-8>single case of them failing to report a serious assault to the police</a>, the other one involving a <a href=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/aug/13/uber-failing-to-report-sex-attacks-by-drivers-says-met-police>legal self-defence dye spray, not pepper spray</a> as the Met alleged</li>
</ul>
