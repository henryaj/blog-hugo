<p>A friend recently asked for help with a job application. One of the questions asked: <em>what is your greatest achievement?</em> It was a struggle to think of much. Anything would do: good art, or a big project, or teaching myself something substantial. But I didn&rsquo;t have anything. For her, I limply suggested she talk about her success as a &lsquo;third culture kid&rsquo;&mdash;integrating herself not only into her parents' cultures but as a transplant in a new culture (she was schooled partly in England and partly in Belgium). But this hardly feels like a triumph. <a href=http://casnocha.com/2010/05/the-age-of-early-selfconception.html>Generation Y was the first to have to write their own biographies</a>. Paul Graham flipped the five most common regrets of the dying and <a href=http://paulgraham.com/todo.html>turned them into daily commands</a>. Maybe asking probing questions of yourself is a useful tool to help find out what you want, or at least to show you that you <a href=http://henrystanley.com/2013/06/20/i-know-i-dont-know-what-i-want/>don&rsquo;t yet know what you want</a>.
