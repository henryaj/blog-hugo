<p>I find it useful during this giddy season to remember that <strong>an emphasis on getting started</strong>, though currently popular, is not timeless. &mldr; Epictetus doesn’t reject action. But he believes commitment to a pursuit must be preceded by the careful study of what is actually required for success. He uses the Olympic games as an example. &mldr; For most budding ancient athletes, Epictetus implies, [the arduous reality of training] would likely dim the glamor of pursuing the Olympics. But not for everyone. As he then concludes: &ldquo;When you have evaluated all this, if your inclination still holds, then go to war.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Paul Graham says something similar in his essay on <a href=http://www.paulgraham.com/love.html>how to do what you love</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[I]f you have a day job you don&rsquo;t take seriously because you plan to be a novelist, are you producing? Are you writing pages of fiction, however bad? As long as you&rsquo;re producing, you&rsquo;ll know you&rsquo;re not merely using the hazy vision of the grand novel you plan to write one day as an opiate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I suspect many people would find both heuristics useful: <em>start cautiously</em>, being realistic about what&rsquo;s needed for success, and <em>always produce</em>. Together, they stop you pining for a life that&rsquo;s not what you thought it would be and guide you towards one you&rsquo;ll love.</p>
