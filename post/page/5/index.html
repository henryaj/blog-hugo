I sometimes wonder how many people are missing out on the best jobs, or relationships, or experiences for lack of better information about the expected value of pursuing them.
When I went to NYC, I stayed a couple nights with a friend. When I saw he was living in a beautiful Brooklyn high-rise with floor-to-ceiling windows and a pool in the basement, I got some idea of the amount of money he was making.

NB &ndash; I have a handful of antibody tests going spare (bought some for friends and family) - message me if you want one.
There&rsquo;s been lots of talk in the media about testing people for SARS-CoV-2 (or &ldquo;coronavirus&rdquo;) infection.
Knowing who&rsquo;s infected is useful: if you&rsquo;re a health worker and you test positive, you know you have to stay at home. But if you test negative, you don&rsquo;t have to lose two weeks of work to self-isolation.

We recently had a massive power outage in Britain, causing mayhem as trains were unable to move, airports had no power, and general pandemonium ensued.
The line at the bottom is a chart of UK grid frequency - you can see it plummet during the recent power outage (normally it&rsquo;s around 50Hz and has to be kept there - if it falls below 49Hz, equipment starts disconnecting automatically as a protective measure).

Obviously I would never ride an electric scooter in London - it&rsquo;s illegal for some reason. But if hypothetically I&rsquo;d been commuting to work on one for the last 7 months, this is the guide I would&rsquo;ve wanted.
The M365 is the king of electric scooters - sturdy, a smoother ride than the competition, and beautifully designed. I highly recommend it.
Purchase I bought my scooter from Gearbest, a Chinese importer.

A few months ago, predicting a leadership contest, I joined the Conservative party. I have no particular interest in supporting them, but party members get the final say in leadership contests. For £2 a month I figured that was a good deal.
Sure enough, there was a leadership contest, and the 180,000 party members (instead of the UK population of 65million) will decide who becomes the next Prime Minister.
(Yes, I don&rsquo;t like them either.

tl;dr: Deploy your Ruby code to Heroku and have it run on GraalVM.
When deploying code in this brave new cloud world we live in, your app pretty much runs as a brain in a vat. It doesn&rsquo;t (and shouldn&rsquo;t) know about the hardware it&rsquo;s running on, how the services it connects to are implemented, how it send data to your log aggregation tool, and so on.1
You get to choose between providing the brain and the vat, or just the brain.

GraalVM promises to be &ldquo;one VM to rule them all&rdquo; – a way to &ldquo;run code faster anywhere&rdquo;.
The way it does this is using language interpreters written in a framework called Truffle:
Truffle is a framework for implementing languages using nothing more than a simple abstract syntax tree interpreter.
These interpreters turn your code into an AST which can be run on the GraalVM. This gives you:

Web frameworks have TodoMVC as a standard exercise, in which you build a little to-do list app. It&rsquo;s a cute way to showcase the features of that framework and get to know it a little better.
My friend Dan Friedman is trying to do the same but for programming languages, with concurrent-wc! It&rsquo;s an exercise to build a utility that mimicks wc -l (which counts the lines in a file), but applied to a whole directory – which is a nice excuse to use some concurrency!

I wanted a way to see who was in the Recurse Center space at any given time – or to be able to check if people were in before deciding whether I wanted to take the L to Manhattan (on a weekend, say).
Wi-fi is nearby I figure someone being connected to the Recurse Center Wi-Fi is a pretty good proxy for whether or not they&rsquo;re in the space.

I really liked Geoffrey Miller&rsquo;s paean to polyamory on Sam Harris' recent podcast. I&rsquo;ve quoted it below; I hope he won&rsquo;t mind me reproducing it here.
Humans have an innate tendency to form long-term pair bonds, no doubt. Pair bonds are extremely important in human evolution: people finding mates, settling down, having a little home, raising kids together, bi-parental care, dads investing&mldr;
So: I&rsquo;m not going to go dis monogamy.

tl;dr: Check out my Observable notebook showing how vast the scale of factory farming is.
Scope insensitivity is our inabiity to grasp really large numbers. When you think about the difference between a million people and a billion people, your brain can&rsquo;t really represent that thousandfold difference, so it gets compressed down to being abstractly &lsquo;larger&rsquo;. We don&rsquo;t suffer the same bias with quantities small enough to visualise.

With twelve weeks to do whatever programming projects I wanted, I figure now is the time to try something I&rsquo;ve never touched before.
Data visualisation is totally foreign to me (at least, anything beyond charts in Excel is). I was aware of d3.js, a JavaScript library for graphing data, so I thought I&rsquo;d try it out.
Turns out it&rsquo;s not a &ldquo;library for graphing data&rdquo; at all. It&rsquo;s really a DOM manipulation library, or a library for processing data and using it to update elements on a webpage.

Cochrane is a body which produces meta-analyses on medical topics – basically, they pick a subject to review, trawl through all the existing scientific papers that have been published, throw away almost all of them because they&rsquo;re too small, not statistically rigorous, or have some other methodological problem, and then use what&rsquo;s left to make a judgement on the topic.
Cochrane reviews are pretty much the gold standard for &ldquo;truth&rdquo; in medical science.

In our first week, we were told that the RC faculty wanted to do one thing above else – to remove any obstacles in the way of us becoming dramatically better programmers.
But what does that mean? What does getting dramatically better actually look like?
I&rsquo;ve outlined a few broad areas that programmers striving to get better might focus on. I&rsquo;ve also suggested some ways to tackle these areas – but this is by no means complete, or correct!

The spacing effect shows that the most efficient way to learn material is to expose yourself to it at increasing intervals, instead of cramming. Spaced repetition learning uses this effect to show you flashcards at intervals optimised for knowledge retention.
This is especially good for learning languages – it&rsquo;s how Duolingo decides when to show you old vocabulary to review. So why not use it for learning programming languages as well?

&mldr;well, not really for profit. The world doesn&rsquo;t need another BitTorrent client. But it&rsquo;s a great project for learning about an interesting web protocol, exploring the networking stack, getting to grips with Wireshark and debugging, and learning how things work.
Reading a .torrent The torrent files you might find somewhere like The Pirate Bay are encoded with bencode (pronounced &ldquo;B-Encode&rdquo;, but I&rsquo;m still gonna say &ldquo;ben-code&rdquo;), a terse file format for representing a few simple data structures (strings, ints, dicts and lists).

Turns out the satellites that power Iridium satphones, beloved of supervillains and Jack Bauer alike, have an interesting feature: their antennas are arranged such that, as they orbit the earth, they briefly reflect sunlight down to us.
The three enormous reflective antennas, set at 120 degrees around the body of the satellite, point towards Earth like the head of an arrow. When the satellite passes perpendicular to the sun, it reflects a bright burst of light at the Earth&rsquo;s surface.

I think EA Funds is an awesome idea – delegate the hard work of deciding where to give money to the experts. I&rsquo;ve donated there in the past, and encouraged others to do so, and I’m glad CEA is putting time into the programme.
However, there are some issues with the way the funds are run. My concerns summarised:
The funds hand out money very infrequently, and hold onto money for long periods of time.

The Uber ban is bad news.
I know more than one person with a disability or chronic illness who relies on Uber – to see friends, to get to work, to get to medical appointments. Those people are literally only able to get around using Uber. They lose a lifeline if Uber is gone, as do thousands of drivers.
Uber also saves lives. Research by Dills and Mulholland finds that the rate of vehicle accidents, assaults and public order offences drops considerably when Uber enters a city.

(This is a work in progress. Let me know your thoughts.)
BOSH is a set of tools &ndash; a CLI, a server (&ldquo;Director&rdquo;) and an agent &ndash; that together let you deploy collections of virtual machines to the cloud. You can deploy on a bunch of different cloud providers: Amazon Web Services, Google Compute Platform, Microsoft Azure and more.
It&rsquo;s notable because it&rsquo;s the de facto deployment tool for Cloud Foundry, the open-source platform-as-a-service.

Marrakech 2 nights at Riad Aguerzame; 1 night at Riad Miski.
Our arrival was bad. Ripped off by rude taxi drivers, taken the long way round the city, and then taken to the wrong place down terrifying streets (think pitch black corners and ceilings you need to crouch to get under). We eventually found our riad. “Oh, we&rsquo;ve been trying to call to see if the driver found you,” said our host.

The Economist lays out what Britain would look like as an EEA member.
This seems the most likely option to me, but has some interesting caveats: all other EEA members are part of the Schengen area (which Britain isn&rsquo;t currently) and make significant contributions to the EU&rsquo;s budget. We presumably would have to do the same. I hope we do. Freedom of movement between member states is one of the most beautiful parts of the EU, and an inspiring piece of supranational engineering.

Examining the Accidental Life:
I remember saving aggressively to fund a summer backpacking trip to Europe in 1998, on a shoestring budget (which I bragged about for years after). Then there were the years and years of road trips, short and long, criss-crossing the US multiple times. Those were good times. Peacefully lost wandering times. As close as you can get in the real human world to hitchhiking the galaxy, armed only with a towel.

How we spend our days is, of course, how we spend our lives. What we do with this hour, and that one, is what we are doing. A schedule defends from chaos and whim. It is a net for catching days. It is a scaffolding on which a worker can stand and labor with both hands at sections of time. A schedule is a mock-up of reason and order—willed, faked, and so brought into being; it is a peace and a haven set into the wreck of time; it is a lifeboat on which you find yourself, decades later, still living.

Stack Overflow released their latest annual developer survey last month. (For any non-programmers reading: Stack Overflow is a website where you can ask questions about programming. For many programming problems, the answer will already be up there. It&rsquo;s an amazing resource that almost everyone in the industry uses.) A few key points stood out for me.
Education: 43% of programmers have a BA or BS in Computer Science or a related field.

I&rsquo;ve suffered from insomnia for as long as I can remember – certainly since I was a teenager. Melatonin has provided some relief, putting me to sleep more quickly and deeply. It&rsquo;s safe to use daily for up to three months; more research is needed on long-term use.1 Melatonin is a tricky to obtain: it&rsquo;s not available in the UK, though you can buy it over-the-counter in the US (and can import it into the UK).

From Will MacAskill&rsquo;s Doing Good Better:
What the conclusions from the economic studies suggest is that the benefit you would get from having your salary doubled is the same as the benefit an extremely poor Indian farmer earning $220 a year would get from an additional $220. As noted earlier, the typical US wage is $28,000 (£18,200), so there is good theoretical reason for thinking that the same amount of money can be of at least one hundred times as much benefit to the very poorest people in the world as it can be to typical citizens of the West.

In Ruby, the pry gem lets you call binding.pry in your code. When it runs, you get dropped into a breakpoint. From there, you can play around with variables and methods, just like you would in a REPL.
Today I learned what binding actually is &ndash; it&rsquo;s an object containing the current execution context at the point it&rsquo;s called. Effectively, it&rsquo;s a snapshot of the state of the Ruby VM at the time the breakpoint is hit.

I&rsquo;ve finally taken the Giving What We Can​ pledge – a commitment to give away (at least) 10% of my income to the most effective charities in the world.
Amounts of money that are relatively small to us in the developed world can make an enormous difference if applied well. An insecticide-treated mosquito net costs around $5. Giving a child a deworming pill to treat schistosomiasis costs a little over a dollar.

For this year, my wish for each of us is small and very simple. And it&rsquo;s this. I hope that in this year to come, you make mistakes. Because if you are making mistakes, then you are making new things, trying new things, learning, living, pushing yourself, changing yourself, changing your world.

My father tells a story of someone he used to work with – someone so totally unacquainted with social norms that he was thought of as &lsquo;an alien&rsquo;.
One day, this man was suggesting some boneheaded idea to his boss. The boss was not impressed with it. The man pressed on: &ldquo;well, gee, you just don&rsquo;t seem to be getting this&mldr;&rdquo; His boss turned puce and said, threateningly: &ldquo;maybe that&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s just the wrong idea.

_Most lives are lived by default_, on David Cain&rsquo;s blog Raptitude, is a favourite piece of mine.
The day-to-day feel and quality of each of our lives sits on a few major structures: where we live, what we do for a living, what we do with ourselves when we’re not at work, and which people we spend most of our time with.
Those four structures – which mostly are handed to us by happenstance – determine the shape of our lives.

Josh Hill and I gave a talk at LOPUG on Concourse, our beloved continuous delivery and pipelining tool. The highlights:
Unlike other CI systems, Concourse puts pipelines first. Everyone has a pipeline of some sort – how automated and well-documented is yours? A pipeline can be a CI/CD process (build → unit → integration → deploy), but can also be used to e.g. version a resource, push code to Amazon S3 or a BOSH release, and all sorts of other things.

From Life Is a Braid in Spacetime by Max Tegmark:
When we think about the present, we mean the time slice through spacetime corresponding to the time when we’re having that thought. We refer to the future and past as the parts of spacetime above and below this slice. [Spacetime as a mathematical structure implies a] universe that can be beautifully described by mathematics. That this is true for our universe has become increasingly clear over the centuries, with evidence piling up ever more rapidly.

Some thoughts on (tech) startups.
Keep it simple. Every decision you make needs to have minimalism at its heart. On features: fewer is better. On copy: it doesn&rsquo;t matter nearly as much as you think it does. On software: don&rsquo;t reinvent the wheel. Use popular frameworks and don&rsquo;t roll your own code when off-the-shelf will do.
Shipped is better than smart. It&rsquo;s easy to get carried away with exotic ideas and interesting code.

Kill the Buddha:
 I interpret Zen Buddhism as a set of practices for not tripping over your own mind – avoiding our tendency to bin experiences into categories so swiftly and completely that we stop actually paying attention to them, not becoming imprisoned by fixed beliefs, not mistaking maps for territories, always remaining attentive to what actually is. Perhaps the most elegant expression of this interpretation is this koan setting forth the problem: “The mind is like a dog.

tl;dr [August 2017]: Makers was amazing, and springboarded me into a career as a software engineer. Most of the coaches who taught me have since moved on, but it seems like the course still graduates consistently employable developers. I earn more than double what I did working in PR, plus benefits (free breakfast!), stock options, and a job I love. Tech is a great industry to be in, and while a bootcamp isn&rsquo;t the only way to break into it, it worked for me.

Sinatra is a DSL (domain-specific language, or a language written for a specific purpose) for building web applications. It can be confusing. If you&rsquo;re a beginner programmer fiddling around with Ruby, the single-user terminal apps you&rsquo;ve been writing are suddenly up on the web for everyone to see, and they need to behave differently as a result.
require 'sinatra' get '/' do 'hello world!' end If you want to run this and get it working, save this into a file (say server.

CoffeeScript is well-documented, succinct language that compiles into JavaScript. If you&rsquo;re bored of JavaScript&rsquo;s abstruse syntax, it&rsquo;s a much more Ruby-like way to approach JavaScript programming – provided you&rsquo;re comfortable with its caveats. This assumes you have node.js installed and have installed Mocha, CoffeeScript and Chai with the following commands from the folder you&rsquo;re working in:
npm install coffee-script npm install chai npm install mocha You can also use the -g flag when running the above commands to install these packages globally, rather than locally.

From _Let&rsquo;s make some Metra noise_1 in the Chicago Tribune:
Commuters asked to interact with other passengers reported having the most pleasant commute. Commuters asked to enjoy their solitude reported the least pleasant commute. The pleasure of conversation was not just restricted to friendly people; we found the same results among introverts and extroverts. If connecting with others is more pleasant than sitting alone, why the strong preference for quiet cars, silent cabs and empty rows on airplanes?

Around 5 pm PST on June 2, 2014, our long-time friend and role model Sasha Shulgin gently died after several years of battling various illnesses. He had recently been diagnosed with terminal liver cancer. Around 6:30 pm we received phone calls from two members of the Shulgin team letting us know the sad news. Much love to his family and those whose lives he touched, from the Erowid Crew.

Encryption and veganism tend be maligned, niche interests. The crypto nerds who keep their laptops under lock and 2048-bit key and those brave enough to completely eschew animal products are similar groups &ndash; both thoughtful and invested in their beliefs. But neither gets much traction in getting others to adopt their practices, because those practices are costly (socially, in time and expense, etc). As the technology behind vegan food has improved, so has the palatability of the product.

Today is The Day We Fight Back. Sign the petition, and join the movement against mass surveillance programmes. Danny O&rsquo;Brien, International Director at the EFF, explains in more detail what the petition is in support of:
The short answer is that you&rsquo;re signing your support for a set of 13 principles on the application of human rights to communications surveillance ( see https://necessaryandproportionate.net/ ), that were worked out last year (pre-Snowden, actually) by a coalition of technologists, privacy activists, and legal scholars &mldr; to push the idea in international venues and among key lawmakers in various countries that mass surveillance (as well as a bunch of other practices conducted by the NSA and other spooks, including corruption of crypto standards and backdoors) is a violation of existing human rights standards.

NS Pritchard left this poetic review for the timeless Casio F91-W:
Cars break down, phones malfunction, computers get infected but the F 91 soldiers on. Cheap and ubiquitous. Everybody seems to have owned one. Its &ldquo;beep beep&rdquo; woke thousands this morning. It measured and guided their days all long. It has a stopwatch, a light, an alarm: This is what I need and all I need from a digital watch.

Most arguments sympathetic to mass surveillance programmes make two points:
that they are reasonable (that is, have adequate regulatory oversight, only target valid intelligence targets, and are legal), and that they are effective. The first claim is demonstrably untrue. The second is doubtful, and unproven.
—
1. Government mass surveillance programmes like PRISM and Tempora are illegal and out of control. We know that, for example, GCHQ lied to the UK National Security Council about the extent of their surveillance programme, that a US government privacy board believes NSA bulk collection of phone data is illegal1, that the NSA monitored calls of 35 world leaders and that they cracked the encryption used in the UN&rsquo;s internal videoconferencing system (in clear breach of international law)2.

Mental prowess in pill form is always tempting. Modafinil offers heightened alertness and wakefulness even during sleep deprivation; piracetam promises enhanced cognition and intercerebral blood flow; ergoloid offers purported memory and anti-ageing enhancements. There are many more. I&rsquo;ve promoted these agents to friends and taken some of them myself.
The philosophical and ethical case for cognitive enhancement is well established1; that they work is (at least for some drugs) beyond doubt2.

Hailo is a London-based tech startup. Its product is a mobile app that lets you find and hail a nearby taxi. It&rsquo;s not the first or last cab-hailing app, but it&rsquo;s best-in-class after a few years and is now also available in a number of other cities around the world. The founders describe themselves as &ldquo;three taxi drivers and three internet entrepreneurs.&rdquo; From a customer&rsquo;s point of view, Hailo fixes a lot of problems that cabs have: sometimes-surly drivers, a pick-up charge, waving one&rsquo;s arm trying to find a cab, having to pay in cash.

FutureFest was yesterday. Here are some (very rough) notes from the talks I heard.
Rachel Armstrong: black sky thinking. Not sure what&rsquo;s going on here. Organic, natural computing and chemistry. Other audience members nearby seemed befuddled.
Tamar Kasriel: business planning for future growth in the face of uncertainly. Scenario planning: Kahn broke apart the way the future is thought of by asking what the world would look like after nuclear way.

It&rsquo;ll be free and and open-source when it comes out, with paid add-ons for extra functionality. And before anyone says it&rsquo;s form over function: it needs to be beautiful if there&rsquo;s going to be significant uptake, which is exactly what encrypted communications needs.

I&rsquo;m trying to be more open to the idea that I don&rsquo;t know what I want. It&rsquo;s easy to get swept up and inherit other people&rsquo;s values wholesale; pause for a moment to reflect on what you really want, or how to find that out.
To be mature you have to realize what you value most. It is extraordinary to discover that comparatively few people reach this level of maturity.

In a previous post of mine, I devoted a couple of paragraphs to summing up the current state of psychological research into happiness. It occurred to me that Eric Weiner&rsquo;s The Geography of Bliss has a much better précis than I did at the time:
Extroverts are happier than introverts; optimists are happier than pessimists; married people are happier than singles, though people with children are no happier than childless couples; Republicans are happier than Democrats; people who attend religious services are happier than those who do not; people with college degrees are happier than those without, though people with advanced degrees are less happy than those with just a BA; people with an active sex life are happier than those without; women and men are equally happy, though women have a wider emotional range; having an affair will make you happy but will not compensate for the massive loss of happiness that you will incur when your spouse finds out and leaves you; people are least happy when they’re commuting to work; busy people are happier than those with too little to do; wealthy people are happier than poor ones, but only slightly.

Is some research too dangerous to be published? Lab-made strains of bird flu have raised questions about state involvement in mitigating the threat from “dual use” research. Henry Stanley explains
In November 2011, a Dutch group succeeded in making a highly pathogenic variant of avian flu (H5N1) which, if released, could cause a global pandemic. Ever since, a storm has raged as scientists and governments worldwide attempt to deal with the findings and how they should be safely disseminated—if at all.

Sasha Shulgin is a legendary chemist and psychonaut and inventor of hundreds of psychedelics. In 1991, he and his wife, Ann, published a book. Part-novel and part-cookbook, PiHKAL—Phenethylamines I Have Known And Loved—told his story and the stories of the compounds he and his friends had ingested, a process he ironically termed ‘LAB’, or Large Animal Bioassay.
It’s a gorgeous book, and a work that is still unmatched in its candour and novelty (and notoriety).

I’m trying to figure out what to do with my life. Give me your thoughts.
Michael Idov writes in his piece Bitter Brew in Slate:
I never realized how ubiquitous the dream of opening a small coffeehouse was until I fell under its spell myself. It seemed that just about every boho-professional couple had indulged in this fantasy at some point or another.
The dream of running a small cafe has nothing to do with the excitement of entrepreneurship or the joys of being one’s own boss—none of us would ever consider opening a Laundromat or a stationery store… The small cafe connects to the fantasy of throwing a perpetual dinner party… To a couple in the throes of the cafe dream, money is almost an afterthought.

For those not in the know, PCR is a standard biological technique that lets you make lots of copies of a piece of template DNA. It’s crucial because a lot of molecular biology relies on having a large amount of a particular DNA, so it makes possible everything from DNA fingerprinting to genomics to forensics to getting bacteria to express a gene of interest. Its invention changed the face of modern biology.

The aging process is complex and multifaceted, but slowing it may be easier than we thought—and in biogerontology, there might be such a thing as a free lunch.
In the 1930s, biogerontologist Clive McKay found that rats whose diets were reduced to sixty per cent of what they would eat normally were living healthily, with glossy fur and eyes unclouded by cataracts, at ages where their normally-fed compatriots were dying1. McKay thought wrongly that it was stunting development that extended lifespan; Ed Masoro would later find that caloric restriction could be started during adulthood and cause a similarly profound drop in mortality2.

This month’s Lates night at the Science Museum—described as an evening of ‘free adults-only entertainment’—put the spotlight on the study of happiness. One event, a talk by Glenn Wilson, touched on a number of aspects of happiness research. In its modern form, positive psychology is a relatively young field, and it focuses specifically on evidence-based methods for improving happiness.
Positive psychology has a few perhaps obvious things to tell us: being employed (or better, self-employed) and having big, external life goals are all sources of happiness.

In May 2010, Craig Venter produced the world’s first ‘synthetic organism’, dealing vitalism a final death blow in the process. Created from a bacterium with its nucleus removed, he inserted an entirely synthetic chromosome bearing DNA famously ‘watermarked’ with quotes from James Joyce and Richard Feynman. The cell promptly took on the identity written into its new genome, like a computer rebooted from a new hard disk.
Understandably, then, you might think that synthetic biology is in its youth.

The approach usually taken to learning is to repeat. A good revision timetable will allow lots of time for reviewing material several times; a bad one will allow less time. With each repetition, each review of a list of bullet points or a slide in a lecture, you learn a little bit more, and the memory sticks a little better. A simple linear relationship between the number of repetitions and the amount remembered.

The pharmaceuticals industry has an obsession with novelty. We want better drugs with fewer side-effects, but too often newness is correlated (wrongly) with an improvement in quality. One new drug that is twice as good at treating an illness as its predecessor is better than five drugs each offering a one per cent improvement on the first. ‘New’ drugs which appear on the market often seem to be derivatives of the well-tested substances which precede them and not genuinely novel drugs.

A fifty-seat room was never going to be big enough. People fill the aisles, sit on the ground and peer around the door. A man comes in a little late clutching a box bearing the LifeExtension ‘nutriceutical’ brand. Sunlight glints through the windows, dappling the trademark grey-speckled beard and ponytail of today’s speaker, the somewhat notorious Aubrey de Grey. For the next two hours, this room will house discussions of whole-brain emulation, ‘strong’ (self-improving) artificial intelligence and molecular medicine’s promise of immortality.
