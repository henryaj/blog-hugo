&lt;p>I sometimes wonder how many people are missing out on the best jobs, or relationships, or experiences for lack of better information about the expected value of pursuing them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I went to NYC, I stayed a couple nights with a friend. When I saw he was living in a beautiful Brooklyn high-rise with floor-to-ceiling windows and a pool in the basement, I got some idea of the amount of money he was making.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong – I knew NYC salaries were high. But having some idea of what your &lt;em>peers&lt;/em> are making (as opposed to knowing the average salary) is incredibly valuable. With that information, I can start to price in what it would cost to explore getting a visa, and whether the expense and hassle of it makes financial sense.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Visas are similarly opaque. Reading official documents gives you a gist of what might be required to get one. But hiring an immigration lawyer is totally different. Their job is to exploit loopholes on your behalf to get you a visa, no matter how eccentric a scheme they have to employ. Another friend told me that initially he came to the US on a J1 visa, ostensibly meant for interns and trainees. His lawyers diligently drew up a &amp;ldquo;training schedule&amp;rdquo; for him to ignore once he arrived.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As the J1 isn&amp;rsquo;t a &amp;ldquo;dual-intent&amp;rdquo; visa, you can&amp;rsquo;t apply for a green card while holding one. You even have to sign a document promising not to. But that doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop &lt;em>someone else&lt;/em> applying on your behalf – which is exactly what his lawyers did. His green card came through last year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Being able to peek behind the veil and see how things are &lt;em>actually done&lt;/em> – not just what the official rubrik says – is vital.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Coronavirus testing</title><link>https://henrystanley.com/coronavirus-testing/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Mar 2020 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://henrystanley.com/coronavirus-testing/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>NB &amp;ndash; I have a handful of antibody tests going spare (bought some for friends and family) - &lt;a href="mailto:henry@henrystanley.com">message me&lt;/a> if you want one.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s been lots of talk in the media about testing people for SARS-CoV-2 (or &amp;ldquo;coronavirus&amp;rdquo;) infection.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Knowing who&amp;rsquo;s infected is useful: if you&amp;rsquo;re a health worker and you test positive, you know you have to stay at home. But if you test negative, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to lose two weeks of work to self-isolation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Likewise, if you&amp;rsquo;re a member of the public, you can be triaged for medical help more quickly if you test positive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are a bunch of ways you can be tested for coronavirus which are quite different - let&amp;rsquo;s review.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="pcr">PCR&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Also known as &lt;strong>molecular testing&lt;/strong>, this technique takes a swab - from the throat or nose usually - and processes it to detect part of the virus' genome.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Specifically, it uses &lt;strong>RT qPCR&lt;/strong> - reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR - to transcribe the virus' genome (which is encoded in RNA) into DNA, and then copy that DNA repeatedly to a quantity that can be detected. The copying process uses a &amp;lsquo;primer&amp;rsquo;, a short piece of DNA which matches part of the viral genome. If the virus is present in the sample, its RNA will be amplified to a detectable level. If there&amp;rsquo;s no virus, the primer won&amp;rsquo;t bind to anything and there&amp;rsquo;ll be no amplified DNA to detect.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>viral RNA -&amp;gt; DNA -&amp;gt; binds to primer -&amp;gt; amplified to detectable signal&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="test-shortages">Test shortages&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This test requires some specialist equipment - mostly the reagents that are used for the test. Preparing RNA is a pain&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, and PCR needs specific enzymes to work (reverse transcriptase and DNA polymerase). It also uses specialist equipment: a &amp;lsquo;thermocycler&amp;rsquo; to raise the temperature of the sample (which causes the DNA strands to separate) and then cool it so the DNA anneals to the primer and the enzymes can do their job (they work much less well at high temperatures).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>DIY thermocyclers aren&amp;rsquo;t too difficult to make. You can always just substitute a modern thermocycler for a few water baths at the right temperature, although obviously this will be very laborious as you have to move the samples from one bath to another. But reagent shortages are what&amp;rsquo;s driving the lack of testing at the moment.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="false-results">False results&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>False negatives can quite easily come from the sample being taken incorrectly. This seems especially likely if people are taking the test at home - nasal and throat swabs are uncomfortable, so it&amp;rsquo;s possible people aren&amp;rsquo;t getting a reliable sample. Similarly, some reports state that &lt;a href="https://www.cebm.net/2020/03/is-there-any-significant-difference-in-sensitivity-of-covid-19-virus-sars-cov-2-tests-based-on-swabs-from-oropharyngeal-op-vs-nasopharyngeal-np-sampling-vs-both/">throat swabs report false negatives more often than nasal swabs&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>False positives are less likely - if there&amp;rsquo;s no viral RNA present, it&amp;rsquo;s not clear how you could get a signal unless the sample was contaminated.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="antibody-serology">Antibody serology&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Another class of tests detect whether your blood contains anti-coronavirus antibodies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These are much like pregnancy tests, which detect hCG (a hormone released during pregnancy). You apply a sample to a piece of paper, and the sample is pulled along by capillary action. It then comes into contact with a reagent that&amp;rsquo;s bound to the paper, like coronavirus spike protein (the &amp;lsquo;antigen&amp;rsquo;, or the molecule that causes an immune response). If the sample contains antibodies which bind that protein, the protein will be dragged along the paper. The protein also has a label attached to it - usually something which causes a colour change in specific conditions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If there&amp;rsquo;s no anti-coronavirus antibody in the sample, it won&amp;rsquo;t bind to the labelled antigen, and no colour change occurs.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>antibody in blood -&amp;gt;
binds to labelled antigen forming a complex -&amp;gt;
antigen passes over detection area -&amp;gt;
anti-human antibody binds to complex -&amp;gt; colour change
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>Coronavirus antibody test kits have two detection areas - one for IgG antibodies and another for IgM antibodies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>IgM antibodies provide your body&amp;rsquo;s initial immune response. If anti-coronavirus IgM is present in the sample, the patient is likely currently infected.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>IgG antibodies are raised later in the infection, and provide long-term immunity. If these are present in the sample, the patient has likely been exposed to coronavirus and fought off the infection.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These tests are quick, giving a result in ten minutes from a drop of blood (obtained by fingerprick), and can be done at home without special equipment. They have some drawbacks: they won&amp;rsquo;t show if someone is infected and asymptomatic/presymptomatic (as they likely haven&amp;rsquo;t raised antibodies against the virus yet), so a negative IgM result could be a false negative.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s also possible to get a false positive as most of the test kits haven&amp;rsquo;t been tested for cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses (like the common cold). This is a big unknown; I assume the testing the UK government is currently doing will include these sorts of assays.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="immunity">Immunity&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The appeal of antibody testing is that it tells you if people have had the virus and are now immune - so can go back to work without fear of infection or of reinfecting others. The heroic among them might also &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/368/bmj.m1256">donate their plasma&lt;/a> to treat coronavirus patients.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s reasonable to assume that people &lt;em>can&lt;/em> develop immunity to coronavirus. There have been some reports of people being &amp;rsquo;re-infected', but it seems likely that these were either false positives, or that the patient never cleared the virus the first time round (i.e. they tested positive, then false negative, then positive).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What isn&amp;rsquo;t clear is how long immunity will last. &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2851497/">SARS patients kept producing anti-SARS antibodies for 2 years&lt;/a>, with reduction in antibody levels in the third year. However, if coronavirus mutates significantly, it&amp;rsquo;s possible that the new mutant will be infectious even to those with previous immunity.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Anyone who&amp;rsquo;s worked in a molecular biology lab will sympathise. Human skin secretes RNAses, or enzymes which break down RNA, as a protection against invading bacteria. Of course, this means if you touch your work surface without gloves and don&amp;rsquo;t clean it properly, your samples are going to end up mysteriously ruined&amp;hellip;&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We recently had a &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-49300025">massive power outage&lt;/a> in Britain, causing mayhem as trains were unable to move, airports had no power, and general pandemonium ensued.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="">&lt;img src="https://henrystanley.com/images/ukgrid.png" alt="UK grid frequency chart">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The line at the bottom is a chart of UK grid frequency - you can see it plummet during the recent power outage (normally it&amp;rsquo;s around 50Hz and has to be kept there - if it falls below 49Hz, equipment starts disconnecting automatically as a protective measure). In total, 1.4 gigawatts (!) of generation went offline.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The coloured bars represent the energy mix. At the point of the blackout, looks like a huge drop in wind as a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hornsea_Wind_Farm">wind farm&lt;/a> went offline, and a smaller drop in CCGT (combined-cycle gas turbine) as a gas plant, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Barford_Power_Station">Little Barford&lt;/a>, went offline simultaneously - and an increase in pumped hydroelectric storage as the grid tries to compensate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(Power grids are magic.)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Xiaomi electric scooter - the missing manual</title><link>https://henrystanley.com/xiaomi-electric-scooter-the-missing-manual/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Jul 2019 09:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://henrystanley.com/xiaomi-electric-scooter-the-missing-manual/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="">&lt;img src="https://henrystanley.com/images/scooter.jpg" alt="Xiaomi M365 electric scooter">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Obviously I would never ride an electric scooter in London - it&amp;rsquo;s illegal for some reason. But if hypothetically I&amp;rsquo;d been commuting to work on one for the last 7 months, this is the guide I would&amp;rsquo;ve wanted.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The M365 is the king of electric scooters - sturdy, a smoother ride than the competition, and beautifully designed. I highly recommend it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="purchase">Purchase&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I bought my scooter from &lt;a href="https://uk.gearbest.com/skateboard/pp_596618.html?wid=1433363">Gearbest&lt;/a>, a Chinese importer. It cost £300 on a &amp;lsquo;flash sale&amp;rsquo; (they have them all the time, so don&amp;rsquo;t pay full price), plus £30 shipping - there were no other taxes or import duty to pay. Crucially, you don&amp;rsquo;t get a UK warranty. They throw in a UK power adapter at least&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Delivery took like three months. That might sound impossibly long, but bear in mind they don&amp;rsquo;t ship immediately: they wait for enough orders to come in, then ship a pallet to Europe (by rail, amazingly!) and break bulk once it gets to Poland or Germany.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I would definitely advise buying direct from a UK importer - you get a warranty, consumer protection, and you don&amp;rsquo;t have to wait three months for the thing to arrive.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="pre-flight">Pre-flight&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Assembly is pretty simple, even without a manual. But before you start riding, you&amp;rsquo;re going to want to make some adjustments.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="taillight-assembly">Taillight assembly&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The scooter has a built in taillight which is notoriously flaky. Two common ways it dies are from the cable (which runs under the rear fender) fraying and breaking, or the connector to the main battery pack getting damaged.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To fix this, remove the rear fender and tape up the connector between the battery pack and the light. Removing the fender is pretty straightforward, but you need to remove three rubber grommets where the fender is attached first - use a knife or something similar to prise them out, then you can unscrew as normal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To stop the taillight cable fraying, you can buy &lt;a href="https://www.purescooters.com/products/3d-printed-under-cable-protector-for-rear-mud-guard-on-the-xiaomi-m365">accessories like this&lt;/a> which protect the joint between the taillight and the cable.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="stem">Stem&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The folding joint on the stem is notoriously shit. So bad that the scooter hire companies just remove it altogether, or have a fixed cover on it (see the Bird scooters). Rarely it can break (make sure your scooter isn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;a href="https://www.mi.com/global/support/mi-electric-scooter-recall-program/">affected by this recall&lt;/a> over the issue), but usually it&amp;rsquo;s just a bit loose, which means the scooter doesn&amp;rsquo;t ride smoothly as the handlebars move back and forth slightly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, follow &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyA1oPJ23jo">this video&lt;/a> to tighten the clasp on the folding joint. You might also want to tighten the bolt that goes down into the stem - this makes the handlebars stiffer to turn, so the scooter feels less twitchy. Then, buy a set of shims (you can find them on eBay) which fit into the joint and pad any remaining gaps. Viola - smooth riding.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="brakes">Brakes&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The brakes will almost certainly need adjusting - mine were pretty slack. Firstly, you can adjust the position of the right-hand brake disc to reduce the travel in the brake: find a video on this as it&amp;rsquo;s a bit tricky (you have to loosen a tiny hex nut, and then reach through the spokes of the wheel to a hex nut on the rear of the brake pad). Then, use a wrench to turn the barrel on the brake cable to tighten it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Remember that the brakes operate in two stages:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>pulling lightly on the lever activates regenerative braking, slowing you down and recharging the battery&lt;/li>
&lt;li>pulling harder on the lever &lt;em>also&lt;/em> engages the disc brake, giving you much more deceleration&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>With practice you get used to the stopping distance, as the brakes can be a bit abrupt.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="street-riding">Street riding&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Once you&amp;rsquo;re all set up, you can hit the road. Maybe practice in a car park or something until you feel confident. The scooter has &amp;lsquo;eco mode&amp;rsquo; - double press the power button and you&amp;rsquo;ll see one LED turn green - which limits the power to the motor, which is nice for learning or letting friends have a ride.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then, just ride it! Put one foot on the footplate and push off with the other one. When you&amp;rsquo;re rolling, push the throttle for power. You&amp;rsquo;ll soon experience the joy of effortlessly swooping around town. My advice:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Riding position can be tricky if you have big feet like me, as the footplate is quite short (and you don&amp;rsquo;t want to put your back foot on the rear fender). I put my front foot at an angle so my toes are beside the front stem, and then the rest of my foot is on the board. My back foot sits behind on tiptoe. It&amp;rsquo;s very comfortable - I&amp;rsquo;ve never felt the need to switch feet during a ride.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Always have the front light on; the power consumption is negligible but you&amp;rsquo;re much more visible.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Hand signals are tricky because keeping the scooter balanced with only one hand is hard. Until you get used to it, always look carefully before you turn. Eventually you can work up to making proper hand signals.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Make sure your brakes are properly adjusted - the regenerative braking alone can slow you down quickly, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work at very low speeds, so if your brakes are slack you might end up bumping into someone.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Oh - &lt;a href="https://www.cochrane.org/CD001855/INJ_wearing-a-helmet-dramatically-reduces-the-risk-of-head-and-facial-injuries-for-bicyclists-involved-in-a-crash-even-if-it-involves-a-motor-vehicle">wear a helmet&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-fuzz">The fuzz&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Yes, strictly speaking electric scooters aren&amp;rsquo;t legal in the UK. In practice, the police are totally disinterested - a colleague of mine described e-scooters as &amp;ldquo;de facto legal&amp;rdquo; because the law isn&amp;rsquo;t enforced. Of course, riding one is at your own risk - if you&amp;rsquo;re caught you can be given up to six penalty points on your driving license and a £300 fine. (In practice you&amp;rsquo;re more likely to receive a small fine and/or be told not to use the scooter.)&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="accessories">Accessories&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I have &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B075H8KPG2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1634&amp;amp;creative=6738&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B075H8KPG2&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=hstan-21&amp;amp;linkId=0529e35f5dfaa14d0a0d4ecd310cd90d">this folding lock&lt;/a> (which I saw a lot of in Tel Aviv, the original home of these scooters). I don&amp;rsquo;t suppose it would do much to deter a committed thief - the rivets holding the metal plates together are a weak point - but it stops people walking off with your scooter. Lock the scooter through the front stay - the one that joins the handlebar stem to the main footplate. &lt;strong>Update&lt;/strong>: had someone try to steal my scooter by pulling the footboard and back wheel all the way through the lock - which survived (though is now pretty mangled). Someone really determined could probably take the back wheel off, though I don&amp;rsquo;t suppose many people would bother. I&amp;rsquo;ll be buying another one of these!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Get &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B06Y1LVLJJ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1634&amp;amp;creative=6738&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B06Y1LVLJJ&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=hstan-21&amp;amp;linkId=b1adbe8d3d4fcf2feacece4bc6c7eb20">this phone mount&lt;/a> - it&amp;rsquo;s excellent for getting directions on the go. I&amp;rsquo;ve mounted mine just to the left of the throttle lever.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="going-pro">Going pro&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;d be remiss if I didn&amp;rsquo;t mention this: the scooter has Bluetooth, which is neat for seeing your speed and how far you&amp;rsquo;ve gone, but can also be used to update the scooter&amp;rsquo;s firmware. Even better, you can &lt;a href="https://m365.botox.bz/">create your own custom firmware&lt;/a> and flash that&amp;hellip; Things to try:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Reduce the motor power constant. This gives you more power and acceleration. You&amp;rsquo;ll soon wonder how you did without it. Obviously this reduces the scooter&amp;rsquo;s range, but for most people this will be an acceptable trade off (I&amp;rsquo;ve never run the battery down lower than 25%, even when making multiple trips).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Increase the KERS min. speed (the speed at which regenerative braking is enabled). Set it high enough and you disable regenerative braking altogether, though it still kicks in when you pull the brake lever. This is my preference - I much prefer being able to coast than the default aggressive regenerative braking kicking in.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Try the &amp;lsquo;Russian throttle algorithm&amp;rsquo;. Okay I have no idea what this is, but maybe you won&amp;rsquo;t die.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s it! Happy riding, and &lt;a href="mailto:henry@henrystanley.com">get in touch&lt;/a> if you have comments.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Boris Johnson addresses the masses</title><link>https://henrystanley.com/boris-johnson-addresses-the-masses/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Jul 2019 09:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://henrystanley.com/boris-johnson-addresses-the-masses/</guid><description>
&lt;p>A few months ago, predicting a leadership contest, I joined the Conservative party. I have no particular interest in supporting them, but party members get the final say in leadership contests. For £2 a month I figured that was a good deal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sure enough, there &lt;em>was&lt;/em> a leadership contest, and the 180,000 party members (instead of the UK population of 65million) will decide who becomes the next Prime Minister.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(Yes, I don&amp;rsquo;t like them either. But to have even a small chance of diluting the influence of a party base who &lt;a href="https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2019/06/18/most-conservative-members-would-see-party-destroye">want to see Brexit delivered even if it literally destroys our economy&lt;/a> - the psychic pain of joining is surely worth it for that.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve already voted for Not Boris. Johnson intends to leave the EU on October 31 &amp;ldquo;come what may&amp;rdquo;, and if necessary without an exit deal in place. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/18/no-deal-brexit-would-plunge-britain-into-a-recession-says-obr">This would be economic suicide&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hunt has pledged to leave, but to try to avoid a no deal Brexit, and has ruled out suspending Parliament to push a deal through without the support of MPs. (It seems pretty two-faced for Brexit campaigners to complain that having a second referendum would be a &amp;ldquo;violation of democracy&amp;rdquo;, but stay silent when the leading candidate suggests proroguing Parliament to entirely bypass MPs.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My party membership gets me a ticket to the hustings. Seeing two identikit politicians fight to the death seemed like a decent way to spend a midweek evening, so I headed to the ExCeL Centre last night to attend.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was extraordinary. If the attendees there were anything like a representative sample of party members, Boris will win by a huge margin.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He arrived on stage to a tremendous standing ovation, with people waving &amp;ldquo;Deliver Brexit&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Back Boris&amp;rdquo; placards. People were filming this - and kept filming long after everyone else had sat down and he&amp;rsquo;d started his opening speech.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The speech itself was inane. Full of pomp and talk of how great Britain is, how we aren&amp;rsquo;t going to be pushed around by Brussels, and how we&amp;rsquo;ll deliver Brexit regardless. A long bit on Mars bars, for some reason - &amp;ldquo;we will have enough glucose and whey powder to make the Mars bars our children so need&amp;rdquo;. Pretty glib given Mark Carney has warned of increased food prices of between 6 and 10% if we leave with no deal. &lt;a href="https://policy-practice.oxfam.org.uk/publications/walking-the-breadline-the-scandal-of-food-poverty-in-21st-century-britain-292978">500,000 people in the UK can&amp;rsquo;t afford enough food to eat&lt;/a>; how much will that number rise with a 10% increase in the cost of food?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He finished by waving a vacuum-packed kipper given to him by the editor of the Daily Express. Brussels eurocrats had forced some poor kipper smoker to include an ice pack with his mail order kippers, you see, thus eating into his profit margins. Once we leave, we won&amp;rsquo;t have to put up with this sort of nonsense!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Except of course we will. If we want to export to the EU we still have to abide by their trade regulations just as we currently do; if they require ice packs with kippers then that&amp;rsquo;s what we&amp;rsquo;ll have to do. And if we crash out of the EU, that kipper smoker will also be charged 12% tariffs on his EU exports.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another standing ovation after his speech. Hunt went next. (People were streaming out of the auditorium as he was speaking.) He was wholesome, but wooden and constipated. Boris is funny, and a better rhetorician. And amazingly, in spite of his history of offense and deceit - people love him. The betting markets agree; £100 on Boris on Betfair Exchange will net you £2 profit if he wins.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>tl;dr: &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->Deploy your Ruby code to Heroku and have it run on GraalVM&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When deploying code in this brave new cloud world we live in, your app pretty much runs as a brain in a vat. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t (and shouldn&amp;rsquo;t) know about the hardware it&amp;rsquo;s running on, how the services it connects to are implemented, how it send data to your log aggregation tool, and so on.&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You get to choose between providing the brain &lt;em>and&lt;/em> the vat, or just the brain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The brain-and-vat option is a &lt;em>container&lt;/em>. This lets you specify pretty much everything you want to run: the OS, all the libraries and utilities installed on that OS, and the app code itself. This is what running a &lt;a href="http://docker.com">Docker&lt;/a> container looks like (e.g. on Kubernetes or ECS).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The brain-only option is what &lt;a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://cloudfoundry.org">Cloud Foundry&lt;/a> offer. For clarification, please refer to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/onsijoe/status/598235841635360768">this helpful haiku&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Here is my source code&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Run it in the cloud for me&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I do not care how&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Those platforms take your code, figure out what the hell it is, and then run it for you. In addition to not needing to provide (or even really think about) an OS, it also lets whoever&amp;rsquo;s running your platform make fixes to your app. If a vulnerability is discovered in some system library, for example, the platform operations team can just swap out the base OS for a patched version. If you&amp;rsquo;ve provided them a container to run, though, it&amp;rsquo;s just an opaque blob &amp;ndash; you need to update the image on which your container is based and then rebuild it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So how do the brain-only providers figure out what you want to run?&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="buildpacks">Buildpacks&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>These are chunks of code that decide:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>what kind of app your app is&lt;/li>
&lt;li>how to compile it into something executable&lt;/li>
&lt;li>how to run that executable&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>These three stages map nicely to the &lt;a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpack-api">three executables that must be present in a buildpack&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>bin/detect&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>bin/compile&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;code>bin/release&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="detect">Detect&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Decides what kind of app you&amp;rsquo;re running. For Ruby, this might be as simple as asking &amp;ldquo;does it have a Gemfile?&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If yes, continue with the compile and release steps. Otherwise, try another buildpack until there are no more left.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="compile">Compile&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Turns your app into an executable (a &amp;lsquo;slug&amp;rsquo; in Heroku parlance; a &amp;lsquo;droplet&amp;rsquo; in Cloud Foundry parlance). For Ruby, this means running &lt;code>bundle install&lt;/code>; for Go, this means &lt;code>dep ensure &amp;amp;&amp;amp; go build&lt;/code>, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="release">Release&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Write a &lt;code>Procfile&lt;/code> that tells the system how to run your app (e.g. &lt;code>rails server&lt;/code>, &lt;code>rackup&lt;/code>, &lt;code>npm start&lt;/code> etc.)&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="graalvm">GraalVM&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>GraalVM is a VM and a set of interpreters capable of taking various kinds of code (Ruby, Python, R, LLVM bitcode, C, languages that target the JVM like Java and Scala) converting them into some intermediate representation, and running them on a highly-optimised VM (itself written in Java).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s been in development for several years, and is capable of running Ruby code four times faster than the next-best runtime, provides hooks to debug your code using Chrome DevTools, and provides seamless interoperability between any of these languages with almost zero overhead.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So why can&amp;rsquo;t I push my Ruby code to Heroku and have it run on GraalVM?&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="instructionsa-idinstructionsa">Instructions&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The source code is &lt;a href="https://github.com/henryaj/truffleruby-buildpack">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>To use on Heroku&lt;/strong>: run &lt;code>heroku buildpacks:add&lt;/code> to add this buildpack to your app, and remove the existing Ruby buildpack. You&amp;rsquo;ll need to have pushed your app at least once before to do this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>To use on Cloud Foundry&lt;/strong>: run &lt;code>cf create-buildpack&lt;/code> to add this buildpack to CF, then update the buildpack order to ensure it runs before the normal Ruby buildpack.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s pretty bare bones at the moment – it won&amp;rsquo;t build your Rails asset cache, for example – but it should be okay at getting basic Ruby apps running. Note that &lt;a href="https://github.com/oracle/truffleruby/blob/master/README.md#current-status">TruffleRuby is still incomplete&lt;/a>, and is missing support for some important Ruby features (native gems won&amp;rsquo;t work, for example), so YMMV.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>These principles are all lifted from the concept of &lt;a href="https://12factor.net/">12-factor apps&lt;/a>, which are apps that have a clean contract with the underlying OS, and are designed to be portable across clouds.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>GraalVM promises to be &lt;a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/One-VM-to-rule-them-all-W%C3%BCrthinger-Wimmer/53e2b31ad6fea91655ecbe64fe66968b934d0160">&amp;ldquo;one VM to rule them all&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a> – a way to &amp;ldquo;run code faster anywhere&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The way it does this is using language interpreters written in a framework called &lt;a href="https://blog.plan99.net/graal-truffle-134d8f28fb69">Truffle&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Truffle is a framework for implementing languages using nothing more than a simple abstract syntax tree interpreter.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>These interpreters turn your code into an AST which can be run on the GraalVM. This gives you:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>super fast performance&lt;/strong> – e.g. a fourfold increase in speed over Ruby&amp;rsquo;s VM; similar performance to V8 for JavaScript.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>JIT compilation and debugging for free&lt;/strong> – use Chrome DevTools to debug running code.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>interoperability with other Truffle languages&lt;/strong> – because multiple languages can target the same VM, you can call code in one language from another with no performance penalty when crossing the language barrier.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://blog.plan99.net/graal-truffle-134d8f28fb69">This article&lt;/a> is an amazing technical introduction to the platform. Below, I&amp;rsquo;ll walk you through getting GraalVM installed and running on your machine.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="mac-quickstart">Mac quickstart&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The community edition of Graal only runs on Linux, so if you&amp;rsquo;re using a Mac, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to emulate! Here&amp;rsquo;s how I did it.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Download the latest release of &lt;a href="https://github.com/oracle/graal/releases">Graal&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Install Docker, either by &lt;a href="https://download.docker.com/mac/static/stable/x86_64/">downloading it&lt;/a> or using Homebrew (&lt;code>brew install docker&lt;/code>).&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;code>cd&lt;/code> into the Graal download directory and start a Docker container as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ docker run -i -t -v&lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">`&lt;/span>pwd&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">`&lt;/span>:/graal ubuntu /bin/bash
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This will bind-mount your current directory to &lt;code>/graal&lt;/code> inside the container. When you&amp;rsquo;re in, you can run &lt;code>cd /graal&lt;/code> and use the binaries in there directly.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="installing-language-packs">Installing language packs&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>GraalVM ships with a JVM and its own versions of &lt;code>node&lt;/code> and &lt;code>npm&lt;/code>, but out of the box you won&amp;rsquo;t be able to run Ruby, Python, or R.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re like me, the first thing you want to do is play around with Ruby on GraalVM. To do this, you need to install TruffleRuby. GraalVM comes with its own package management tool, &lt;code>gu&lt;/code>, which you can invoke from inside the container:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-console" data-lang="console">root# /graal/bin/gu install ruby
Downloading: Component catalog
Processing component archive: Component ruby
Downloading: Component ruby
Installing new component: TruffleRuby (org.graalvm.ruby, version 1.0.0-rc4)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h2 id="using-the-debugger">Using the debugger&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Graal comes with an awesome debugger that lets you step through your code in Chrome DevTools. To do this, you need to allow connections between your container and the host machine.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ docker run -i -t -v&lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">`&lt;/span>pwd&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">`&lt;/span>:/graal &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">\
&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">&lt;/span> -p 9229:9229/tcp ubuntu /bin/bash
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>That &lt;code>-p&lt;/code> flag opens a port on &lt;code>9229&lt;/code> on both the container and the host. When you run a Graal command and invoke the debugger, you need to tell it to use that port, and to bind to 0.0.0.0 (as by default it binds to 127.0.0.1 which refuses incoming connections from outside the container):&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-console" data-lang="console">root# /graal/bin/ruby --inspect=&amp;#34;0.0.0.0:9229&amp;#34; mycode.rb

To start debugging, open the following URL in Chrome:
chrome-devtools://devtools/bundled/js_app.html?ws=0.0.0.0:9229/ffffffff84647ae2-ffffffa709c7325d
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Graal will print out a URL that you can copy and paste into Chrome which will drop you into a debugger session.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Web frameworks have &lt;a href="http://todomvc.com/">TodoMVC&lt;/a> as a standard exercise, in which you build a little to-do list app. It&amp;rsquo;s a cute way to showcase the features of that framework and get to know it a little better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My friend Dan Friedman is trying to do the same but for programming languages, with &lt;a href="https://github.com/dan-f/concurrent-wc/">&lt;code>concurrent-wc&lt;/code>&lt;/a>! It&amp;rsquo;s an exercise to build a utility that mimicks &lt;code>wc -l&lt;/code> (which counts the lines in a file), but applied to a whole directory – which is a nice excuse to use some concurrency!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Seeing as he and &lt;a href="https://github.com/nicolashahn">Nick&lt;/a> had already written a Go implementation, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d try my hand at Ruby.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While being a lovely language, Ruby unfortunately doesn&amp;rsquo;t have very powerful concurrency features. Don&amp;rsquo;t expect stellar performance!&lt;/p>

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>The &lt;code>Thread&lt;/code> primitive in Ruby is confusing. Prior to Ruby 1.9, these were &amp;ldquo;green threads&amp;rdquo;, meaning the Ruby VM runs them in a single native thread, onto which it multiplexes the execution of these pretend threads.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, as of Ruby 1.9 (we&amp;rsquo;re on 2.4.something at the moment), &lt;a href="https://csinaction.com/2014/10/10/multithreading-in-the-mri-ruby-interpreter/">&lt;code>Thread&lt;/code> actually creates a real, native OS thread&lt;/a>. &lt;em>However&lt;/em>: these threads don&amp;rsquo;t actually run concurrently (even if they do exist in parallel) because the Ruby VM holds a Global VM Lock (GVL) which ensures only one thread is active at once.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So this isn&amp;rsquo;t likely to give us much of a speedup.&lt;/p>

&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">end&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>It gets a bit gnarly here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re doing much the same as before, but instead of calling &lt;code>Thread.new&lt;/code>, we call &lt;code>fork&lt;/code>. At that point in the code, an entirely new process is made, bringing with it a copy of the Ruby VM.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once we&amp;rsquo;re inside the &lt;code>fork&lt;/code> block, we&amp;rsquo;re running in a totally separate process from the parent. As we&amp;rsquo;re not sharing the memory of the parent at all, we can&amp;rsquo;t just write to a hash – the child process has &lt;em>its own copy&lt;/em> of that hash, so there&amp;rsquo;s no way for the parent to know what updates it&amp;rsquo;s making.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instead, we have to use inter-process communication. Here, I open a UNIX pipe, have each process write their result to it, and read from the pipe until it&amp;rsquo;s drained.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="performance">Performance&lt;/h2>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>$ ruby test.rb ~/Desktop

System threads and socket IPC - 0.437s
Green threads - 0.460s
Base case - 0.351s
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>Yeah. Not a huge win for Ruby&amp;rsquo;s concurrency primitives here. The added overhead of green threads and native OS threads outweighs any concurrency gain, it seems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However: the native threaded version can be tweaked a bit. Spawning a new thread for each file we want to parse doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense. Can we just make a small number of threads, one for each core of the machine&amp;rsquo;s processor, and assign work to those threads dynamically, like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroutine">coroutines&lt;/a>?&lt;/p>

&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">end&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>So, there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of horror here. For each coroutine, we create a pair of joined sockets (Ruby&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code>Socket.pair()&lt;/code> makes a syscall to &lt;a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/socketpair.2.html">&lt;code>socketpair(2)&lt;/code>&lt;/a>). One end gets kept by the parent process, and the other by the child process. They then use these to communicate – the parent sending in a list of files for the children to process; the children sending back the results (until they receive the &amp;ldquo;BREAK&amp;rdquo; signal, where they terminate).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(Note that the implementation of these coroutines is very basic. I&amp;rsquo;m using an &lt;code>Enumerator&lt;/code> to loop through all the processes round-robin, rather than assigning work to processes that are idle, which would be much more efficient.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And the results?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I wanted a way to see who was in the Recurse Center space at any given time – or to be able to check if people were in before deciding whether I wanted to take the L to Manhattan (on a weekend, say).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="wi-fi-is-nearby">Wi-fi is nearby&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I figure someone being connected to the Recurse Center Wi-Fi is a pretty good proxy for whether or not they&amp;rsquo;re in the space.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Every packet your machine sends out has a source and destination &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address">MAC address&lt;/a> written into it. When you send a packet to a machine on your local network, your computer needs to figure out which machine you&amp;rsquo;re referring to when you ask for e.g. 192.168.0.12. It does this by &lt;a href="https://www.tummy.com/articles/networking-basics-how-arp-works/">consulting an ARP table&lt;/a>, which lists the known local machines' MAC addresses and their corresponding IP addresses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://henrystanley.com/images/packet.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why are MAC addresses useful? MAC addresses don&amp;rsquo;t change&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, hence the moniker &amp;ldquo;burned-in address&amp;rdquo;. (If they changed, that ARP table wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be very useful). Tools like &lt;a href="https://www.wireshark.org/">Wireshark&lt;/a> let you trivially collect packets from a network you&amp;rsquo;re connected to. If I can snoop on these packets, have a look at their sender MAC address, and tie that back to an individual, I can see who&amp;rsquo;s in.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="getting-mac-addresses">Getting MAC addresses&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Wireshark has a command-line tool, &lt;code>tshark&lt;/code>. I only care about the MAC addresses, not the rest of the packet, so I can set the &lt;code>Tfields&lt;/code> flag to only return the &lt;code>eth.addr&lt;/code> field:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ tshark -Tfields -e eth.addr

5c:91:5d:bc:56:31,67:56:76:aa:91:55
...
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>The source and destination MAC addresses are clearly visible. I still don&amp;rsquo;t know who they belong to, though.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="signing-up">Signing up&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To tie a MAC address to a user, Recursers simply send their MAC address to this friendly bot:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://henrystanley.com/images/zulip_bot.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The payload sent to the chat bot includes the message, plus some details of the sender that Zulip provides, including their email address. I can use that to &lt;a href="https://github.com/henryaj/rcdash/blob/698183d3340efd52dc6ca85267d25c82f3242a91/lib/auth.rb#L34-L42">look them up on the Recurse Center directory&lt;/a> to get a photo, a link to their directory page, etc. Now I know what MAC belongs to who.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="whos-in">Who&amp;rsquo;s in?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>With all the parts in place, I can start sniffing. A script runs on a Raspberry Pi in the RC space which sniffs MAC addresses and sends a list of seen MAC addresses to a webserver. This server looks them up against users it knows about – and if it finds any, &lt;a href="https://github.com/henryaj/rcdash/blob/698183d3340efd52dc6ca85267d25c82f3242a91/lib/server.rb#L35-L45">it marks them as &amp;lsquo;seen&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://henrystanley.com/images/rcdash-wireframe.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="addendum">Addendum&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Unfortunately, the project proved controversial from a privacy perspective: not everyone was comfortable with their MAC address being sent to a private server. I ended up taking it offline.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During the conversation it prompted, some interesting alternatives were proposed:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>hashing and salting the MAC addresses to keep them secret from the server&lt;/li>
&lt;li>keeping a list of &amp;lsquo;opted-in&amp;rsquo; MAC addresses on the Pi and only sending those over the network, not the full list&lt;/li>
&lt;li>having users install a daemon that registers with the site, instead of using MAC addresses&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>It should be noted, though, that MAC address sniffing is already ubiquitous. It&amp;rsquo;s being used to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jan/21/shops-track-smartphone-uk-privacy-watchdog-warns">track footfall in stores&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2017/02/heres-what-tfl-learned-from-tracking-your-phone-on-the-tube/">identify users' routes on public transport&lt;/a>, and even &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-23665490">embedded in trash cans to deliver targeted advertising&lt;/a>. All of which means your MAC address is almost certainly already public knowledge.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>UPDATE&lt;/strong>: I ended up modifying the sniffer to &lt;a href="https://github.com/henryaj/rcdash/blob/d9ba920ce3612606645c5d87dd2ad87d579eadfa/lib/mac.rb#L15-L18">salt and hash MAC addresses&lt;/a> before saving them or &lt;a href="https://github.com/henryaj/rcdash/blob/d9ba920ce3612606645c5d87dd2ad87d579eadfa/lib/sniff_mac_addresses#L37-L41">sending them over the wire&lt;/a> – so I can just match the salted hash without my code ever seeing a MAC address.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I really liked &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/G5M8r9sLKi0?t=27m">Geoffrey Miller&amp;rsquo;s paean to polyamory&lt;/a> on Sam Harris' recent podcast. I&amp;rsquo;ve quoted it below; I hope he won&amp;rsquo;t mind me reproducing it here.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Humans have an innate tendency to form long-term pair bonds, no doubt. Pair bonds are extremely important in human evolution: people finding mates, settling down, having a little home, raising kids together, bi-parental care, dads investing&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>So: I&amp;rsquo;m not going to go dis monogamy. It has been a wildly successful way to take hominid pair bonds and update them for agricultural and industrial civilizations in ways that work for most people, most of the time, pretty well.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>But in the modern world the issue is: are your kids or grandkids seriously going to pursue lifelong monogamous marriage as their default? The surveys among millennials and Gen Zs say no. A lot of them don&amp;rsquo;t want that. So what are they going to do? We don&amp;rsquo;t know.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I think of it as kind of a Cambrian explosion of different relationship patterns. Most of which will end up being dumb and fail. But the ones that don’t fail will be great learning experiences for updating monogamy and figuring out how to do it, or something else, better.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>A lot of polyamorists say jealousy is a social construct&amp;hellip; I think, on the contrary, evolution created sexual and emotional jealousy for very, very good reasons. They are deep instincts; they have important adaptive functions. However, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you have to let them rule your life. &lt;em>Better Angels of Our Nature&lt;/em> is all about how we have these aggressive homicidal instincts, but we&amp;rsquo;ve managed to drop the rate of homicide by orders of magnitude.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I think the same thing could be done with jealousy. But most people aren’t willing to try. They’re terrified of jealousy, and can’t imagine being in a relationship where they’re comfortable with their partner going out on a date for a night. That terrifies them more than, like, &lt;em>bankruptcy&lt;/em>&amp;hellip; But it&amp;rsquo;s survivable.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>What are the upsides? It&amp;rsquo;s fun. You get to meet more people. I think humans are actually evolved to use sex to make friends, and I&amp;rsquo;m not being totally facetious about that. Sex is a great way to get to know somebody better very quickly. You sort of are recreating a tribe in a way that a lot of modern alienated people in society don&amp;rsquo;t have.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>A lot of people who are in long-term relationships get &amp;hellip; locked into this duet with a partner and you’re isolated, on your own, without any genuine romantic or emotional engagement with anyone else. A lot of people feel ‘either I’m stuck in this, bored to tears, or we break up the relationship.’ There is a third alternative.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>&lt;em>The full transcript of the segment is below.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>HARRIS: So why isn&amp;rsquo;t [polyamory] more trouble than it&amp;rsquo;s worth?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>MILLER: Humans have an innate tendency to form long-term pair bonds, no doubt. Pair bonds are extremely important in human evolution: people finding mates, settling down, having a little home, raising kids together, bi-parental care, dads investing – that has been crucial to human evolution for at least a million years.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then it&amp;rsquo;s gotten ritualized culturally into the expectation of lifelong monogamous marriage, and every large successful civilization in human history has adopted monogamous marriage as the typical mating pattern&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So: I&amp;rsquo;m not going to go dis monogamy. It has been a wildly successful way to take hominid pair bonds and update them for agricultural and industrial civilizations in ways that work for most people, most of the time, pretty well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However. They can be oppressive to certain people who have certain values or certain life situations or simply certain personalities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you go back and ask &amp;lsquo;what were the original cultural and social functions of monogamous marriage?&amp;rsquo;, a lot of them had to do with things like reduce the transmission rate of STDs, ensure paternity certainty (that your kid is who you think your kid is), manage inheritance of wealth and land, and it was also crucially about spreading reproductive opportunities fairly evenly across young males and young females so nobody monopolizes the mating market. And that all worked very very well – you couldn&amp;rsquo;t have had Chinese or Roman or medieval European civilization work as well as it did without monogamy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But in the modern world the issue is: are your kids or grandkids seriously going to pursue lifelong monogamous marriage as their default? The surveys among millennials and Gen Zs say no. A lot of them don&amp;rsquo;t want that. So what are they going to do? We don&amp;rsquo;t know. (This is probably the topic of my next book.) But I think we have to look at the all the different sexual subcultures that have tried different kinds of mating patterns – monogamy, polygamists, polyamorists, asexuals - figure out what are the lessons learned from each of those subcultures&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think of it as kind of a Cambrian explosion of different relationship patterns. Most of which will end up being dumb and fail. But the ones that don’t fail will be great learning experiences for updating monogamy and figuring out how to do it, or something else, better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>HARRIS: How do you deal with jealousy? How do you deal with one partner in the relationship hooking up more?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>MILLER: The success and failure rate seems comparable at least in terms of how happy people are in these relationships short-term; we don&amp;rsquo;t yet have good data on how stable are they long-term&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In terms of the jealousy issue, here&amp;rsquo;s where I part company with the standard polyamory culture. A lot of polyamorists say jealousy is a social construct&amp;hellip; I think, on the contrary, evolution created sexual and emotional jealousy for very, very good reasons. They are deep instincts; they have important adaptive functions. However, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you have to let them rule your life. &lt;em>Better Angels of Our Nature&lt;/em> is all about how we have these aggressive homicidal instincts, but we&amp;rsquo;ve managed to drop the rate of aggressive homicide by orders of magnitude over the last thousands of years. That was a win for civilisation. Taking aggressive instincts and harnessing them, and managing them, and making them not run our lives.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think the same thing could be done with jealousy. But most people aren’t willing to try. They’re terrified of jealousy, and can’t imagine being in a relationship where they’re comfortable with their partner going out on a date for a night. That terrifies them more than, like, bankruptcy&amp;hellip; But it&amp;rsquo;s survivable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s fun. You get to meet more people. I think humans are actually evolved to use sex to make friends, and I&amp;rsquo;m not being totally facetious about that. Sex is a great way to get to know somebody better very quickly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>HARRIS: That&amp;rsquo;s a tweetable meme, I think.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>MILLER: The poly culture tends to be very tightly socially networked, and that can bring a lot of benefits: socially, emotionally, professionally, in terms of careers, in terms of cost savings&amp;hellip; You sort of are recreating a tribe in a way that a lot of modern alienated people in society don&amp;rsquo;t have.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A lot of people who are in long-term relationships get stale, their self-image is “I don’t know whether I’m an interesting person any more. I don’t know how attractive I am any more. I don’t know who I am, what my interests are.” You get locked into this duet with a partner and you’re isolated, on your own, without any genuine romantic or emotional engagement with anyone else and I think for a lot of married couples that can be extremely alienating…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A lot of people feel ‘either I’m stuck in this, bored to tears, or we break up the relationship.’ There is a third alternative.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>🔗 Drug elimination calculator</title><link>https://henrystanley.com/drug-elimination-calculator/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jun 2018 18:19:56 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://henrystanley.com/drug-elimination-calculator/</guid><description>

&lt;p>tl;dr: Check out my &lt;a href="https://beta.observablehq.com/@henryaj/where-we-donate-and-why-it-matters">Observable notebook&lt;/a> showing how vast the scale of factory farming is.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_neglect">Scope insensitivity&lt;/a> is our inabiity to grasp really large numbers. When you think about the difference between a million people and a billion people, your brain can&amp;rsquo;t really represent that thousandfold difference, so it gets compressed down to being abstractly &amp;lsquo;larger&amp;rsquo;. We don&amp;rsquo;t suffer the same bias with quantities small enough to visualise.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wanted to see if I could build visualisations to address this. Numbers on a page don&amp;rsquo;t do it – is there a way to &lt;em>show&lt;/em> these large numbers in a way that people can empathise with?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I used some facts and figures from &lt;a href="https://animalcharityevaluators.org/donation-advice/why-farmed-animals/">&lt;em>Why Farmed Animals?&lt;/em>&lt;/a> by Animal Charity Evaluators. They rightly point out that, even though most of the animals killed in the US are killed for food, charities trying to help farmed animals receive very little financial support. Animal shelters receive much more, even though few animals are killed in shelters, relatively speaking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Using &lt;a href="https://github.com/tomgp/d3-iconarray">d3-iconarray&lt;/a>, I built some figures similar to the ones in the ACE article.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s where Americans donate:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://henrystanley.com/images/animal-donations.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>and here&amp;rsquo;s a very different picture – where animals actually get used:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://henrystanley.com/images/animals-used.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some of the figures surfaced are really unbelievable, like this one:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>279 chickens [were] killed per second. An additional 13 other farmed animals were killed per second &amp;hellip; [T]hese numbers are for the U.S. alone.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>292 animals per second – most of whom likely had an unhappy life. This is a staggering number. I wanted to find a way to visualise it, to give it more visual weight.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Initially, I wrote some code to paint dots on the page which would expand and fade out, one per animal killed:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>With &lt;a href="https://recurse.com">twelve weeks&lt;/a> to do whatever programming projects I wanted, I figure now is the time to try something I&amp;rsquo;ve never touched before.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Data visualisation is totally foreign to me (at least, anything beyond charts in Excel is). I was aware of &lt;a href="https://d3js.org/">d3.js&lt;/a>, a JavaScript library for graphing data, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d try it out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Turns out it&amp;rsquo;s not a &amp;ldquo;library for graphing data&amp;rdquo; at all. It&amp;rsquo;s really a &lt;em>DOM manipulation library&lt;/em>, or a library for processing data and using it to update elements on a webpage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That confusion was probably why I found it so damn hard to get it to actually &lt;em>do&lt;/em> anything I wanted.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="getting-started">Getting started&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Almost always, when you&amp;rsquo;re starting out with d3, you ask it to create an SVG element on a webpage. This becomes the canvas on which you paint everything else.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-js" data-lang="js">&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">let&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">width&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">800&lt;/span>

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve now bound a &lt;a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/a551afef97a6955d01728c1382c2da833077fb36/src/selection/index.js#L43">&lt;code>Selection&lt;/code>&lt;/a> to the &lt;code>svg&lt;/code> variable. &lt;code>Selection&lt;/code> has a bunch of methods defined on it which we can use to manipulate the underlying DOM element (an &lt;code>&amp;lt;svg&amp;gt;&lt;/code> HTML object, in this case).&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="grouping-elements">Grouping elements&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The SVG standard defines a &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/g">&lt;code>&amp;lt;g&amp;gt; element&lt;/code>&lt;/a>, a very boring container element used to group things together. A bit like HTML&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code>&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/code>. You can also define attributes on a &lt;code>&amp;lt;g&amp;gt;&lt;/code> tag and its child elements will inherit them.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This inserts a &lt;code>&amp;lt;g&amp;gt;&lt;/code> element into the element represented by the caller (in this case, we&amp;rsquo;re putting our new &lt;code>&amp;lt;g&amp;gt;&lt;/code> element inside an &lt;code>&amp;lt;svg&amp;gt;&lt;/code>).&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-js" data-lang="js"> .&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">selectAll&lt;/span>(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;rect&amp;#34;&lt;/span>)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Selects all the &lt;code>&amp;lt;rect&amp;gt;&lt;/code> elements inside the new &lt;code>&amp;lt;g&amp;gt;&lt;/code> element. In the first instance, there won&amp;rsquo;t be any such elements, so we get an empty list. That&amp;rsquo;s fine.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-js" data-lang="js"> .&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">data&lt;/span>([...])

&lt;p>Specifies some data to work with.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>

.&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">append&lt;/span>(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;rect&amp;#34;&lt;/span>)
.&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">attr&lt;/span>(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;fill&amp;#34;&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;blue&amp;#34;&lt;/span>)
.&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">attr&lt;/span>(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;x&amp;#34;&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">xPosition&lt;/span>(&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">d&lt;/span>))
.&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">attr&lt;/span>(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;y&amp;#34;&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">yPosition&lt;/span>(&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">d&lt;/span>))
.&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">attr&lt;/span>(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;width&amp;#34;&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">50&lt;/span>)
.&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">attr&lt;/span>(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;height&amp;#34;&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">50&lt;/span>)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>And now the magic: take our data, and &lt;em>whenever a new data point &lt;code>.enter()&lt;/code>s the dataset&lt;/em>, append a new &lt;code>&amp;lt;rect&amp;gt;&lt;/code> with properties (blue, 50 x 50, etc).&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>You may have guessed that &lt;code>.enter&lt;/code> has &lt;code>.exit&lt;/code> and &lt;code>.update&lt;/code> counterparts, for defining actions to take when data points leave the set or are updated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The thinking behind this API is that it&amp;rsquo;s much more straightforward to &lt;a href="https://bost.ocks.org/mike/join/">declaratively tell d3 &lt;em>what you want&lt;/em> rather than how to render it&lt;/a>. This makes all sorts of crazy stuff trivial: live data updates, real-time charts, and interactive visualisations.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="scaling-data">Scaling data&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When we set the co-ordinates for our beautiful blue rectangles, we call &lt;code>xPosition&lt;/code> or &lt;code>yPosition&lt;/code> on the data point. These functions might look something like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-js" data-lang="js">&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">let&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">xPosition&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">d3&lt;/span>.&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">scaleLinear&lt;/span>()
.&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">domain&lt;/span>([&lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">1&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">4&lt;/span>])
.&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">range&lt;/span>([&lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">0&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">+&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">margin&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">width&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">-&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">margin&lt;/span>]);
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>By calling &lt;code>d3.scaleLinear&lt;/code>, we get a function which will take a number and scale it up or down to something more appropriate. &lt;code>domain&lt;/code> describes the data domain, and &lt;code>range&lt;/code> is the desired range that data should fill. Here, the domain is numbers between 1 and 4, and the range is any value that would put the &lt;em>x&lt;/em> co-ordinate of our &lt;code>&amp;lt;rect&amp;gt;&lt;/code> inside the SVG (with a little bit of padding).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>yPosition&lt;/code> does something similar, but for the &lt;em>y&lt;/em> co-ordinate. SVG has a quirk, though: &lt;em>y&lt;/em> co-ordinates go from &lt;em>top to bottom&lt;/em> (so the top of the element is zero).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The above is actually most of what you need to build something with d3 (though what I&amp;rsquo;ve described barely scratches the surface of what&amp;rsquo;s possible) – just don&amp;rsquo;t expect the library to do much for you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In my experience, going through examples of d3 visualisations written by other people (read: &lt;a href="https://bost.ocks.org/mike/">Mike Bostock&lt;/a>) is the best way to find inspiration.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>More concretely, you might find that the higher-level abstractions offered by some of &lt;a href="https://github.com/wbkd/awesome-d3">these awesome libraries&lt;/a> is easier for getting started.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>In part 2, I&amp;rsquo;ll write about my attempts to visualise large numbers using d3 and &lt;a href="http://https://beta.observablehq.com/">Observable&lt;/a>.&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hey, Cochrane - quick answers to medical questions</title><link>https://henrystanley.com/hey-cochrane-quick-answers-to-medical-questions/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Jun 2018 10:33:20 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://henrystanley.com/hey-cochrane-quick-answers-to-medical-questions/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://cochrane.org">Cochrane&lt;/a> is a body which produces meta-analyses on medical topics – basically, they pick a subject to review, trawl through all the existing scientific papers that have been published, throw away almost all of them because they&amp;rsquo;re too small, not statistically rigorous, or have some other methodological problem, and then use what&amp;rsquo;s left to make a judgement on the topic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cochrane reviews are pretty much the gold standard for &amp;ldquo;truth&amp;rdquo; in medical science. They very much err on the side of caution, so it&amp;rsquo;s possible that an intervention does work but that the evidence put forward for it isn&amp;rsquo;t strong enough to be sure. But if Cochrane comes out singing a treatment&amp;rsquo;s praises – as they did with the &lt;a href="http://www.cochrane.org/news/scientific-expert-reaction-new-cochrane-review-hpv-vaccine-cervical-cancer-prevention-girls-and">HPV vaccine&lt;/a> – you can be pretty confident that it works.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In our first week, we were told that the RC faculty wanted to do one thing above else – to remove any obstacles in the way of us becoming &lt;em>dramatically better programmers&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But what does that mean? What does getting &lt;em>dramatically better&lt;/em> actually look like?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve outlined a few broad areas that programmers striving to get better might focus on. I&amp;rsquo;ve also suggested some ways to tackle these areas – but &lt;em>this is by no means complete, or correct!&lt;/em> &lt;a href="mailto:henry@henrystanley.com">Email me&lt;/a> with your suggestions; I&amp;rsquo;ll add them and credit you below.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="learning-skills-directly">Learning skills directly&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>On the face of it, object-level&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> skills seem to be relatively narrow in their application – why learn Haskell or Go unless I&amp;rsquo;m going to use it in my job?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But knowledge in programming undergoes compounding&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. Each extra thing you learn isn&amp;rsquo;t isolated, but connected to other nodes in your knowledge graph in ways you might not predict. Getting to grips with Go&amp;rsquo;s unusual concurrency model, while not directly relevant to your day job, might shed light on that tricky concurrency problem you&amp;rsquo;re facing in another language. Fiddling around with metaprogramming in Ruby could prove useful when you&amp;rsquo;re trying to write something in another dynamic language.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="-picking-skills">💡 Picking skills&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Pick nodes on the knowledge graph which are highly-connected to things you do routinely. For example, if you&amp;rsquo;re a Ruby developer, five minutes spent learning how to use the &lt;a href="https://github.com/pry/pry">&lt;code>pry&lt;/code> debugger&lt;/a> will provide an enormous and immediate return on investment.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In this sense, you should lean towards improving highly general skills, like getting to grips with your OS, VCS, text editor, and keyboard shortcuts.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There may be other nodes on the graph which, while not being super close to your area of expertise, are still highly-connected (perhaps indirectly through other nodes). This explains why learning a language that&amp;rsquo;s very different from the one you normally use can be useful: it can add high-level concepts which can be applied to other domains.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>One person in the previous RC batch found experimenting with Idris and type-driven development to be not only super interesting, but very relevant as a primer on type theory – which fits into pretty much ever other language.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="known-unknowns">Known unknowns&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>As you learn more skills, you along the way start to create a map not just of the things you&amp;rsquo;ve learned, but the landscape of things you know exist but haven&amp;rsquo;t yet conquered. These &lt;em>known unknowns&lt;/em> are vitally important in informing what it is you want to learn next, and knowing where to look for solutions when solving problems.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="-identifying-known-unknowns">💡 Identifying known unknowns&lt;/h4>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Produce a more complete map of your knowledge graph of a subject – ideally including areas you know exist but don&amp;rsquo;t know much about. Try to expand the graph beyond your known unknowns by reading around the subject, or teaming up with an expert.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="learning-meta-skills">Learning meta-skills&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There are also meta-skills you can learn: skills which themselves enable skill acquisition.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="how-to-learn-deliberate-practice">How to learn; deliberate practice&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Though the idea of &amp;lsquo;learning styles&amp;rsquo; (e.g. being a visual, aural or kinaesthetic learner) is &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/04/the-myth-of-learning-styles/557687/">likely a myth&lt;/a>, no doubt people have their idiosyncrasies in how they prefer to learn and what works best for them. Spending time trying different methods to evaluate what&amp;rsquo;s best for you will surely pay dividends.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Figuring out how best to do &lt;a href="https://jamesclear.com/beginners-guide-deliberate-practice">deliberate practice&lt;/a> in the field you&amp;rsquo;re interested in is also a challenge. Consider that many people still type with two fingers, despite typing daily for many years. Repetition isn&amp;rsquo;t sufficient to learn a new skill – you need to challenge yourself. Expect this to be painful.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="-getting-better-at-deliberate-practice">💡 Getting better at deliberate practice&lt;/h4>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>James Clear has an &lt;a href="https://jamesclear.com/beginners-guide-deliberate-practice">amazing guide to deliberate practice&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Broadly speaking, you need to &lt;em>do things that challenge you&lt;/em> and &lt;em>get feedback&lt;/em>.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Doing things that challenge you means doing really hard things that test the limit of what you&amp;rsquo;re capable of, not just repeating and replaying old knowledge. If you&amp;rsquo;re highly familiar with a programming language, use a new one. You probably instinctively know how frustrating it is to use a language you aren&amp;rsquo;t fluent in – that&amp;rsquo;s a good sign.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Getting feedback can be getting your code reviewed, pair programming, or even the linter/compiler telling you your code sucks, but it&amp;rsquo;s crucial that you have a feedback loop to keep you on track.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="identifying-common-mistakes">Identifying common mistakes&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>David Cain calls this &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://www.raptitude.com/2018/05/where-success-leaks/">the hole where all the success leaks out&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>When amateurs [play tennis], they don’t edge each other out by being slightly more skillful. Instead, it’s a contest of who makes the fewest huge, gaping blunders.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And of course it works that way. Getting to the pros is a long, arduous process, one that filters out players with major flaws in their game. Coaches leap on those flaws as soon as they see them and drill them out of their athletes. Amateurs don’t go through this filtering process&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Everyone’s strategy, therefore, should be to identify and eliminate these big, costly rookie blunders, one by one.&lt;/strong> This is far more effective than getting quicker, hitting harder, or making that one brilliant shot now and then.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h4 id="-identifying-common-mistakes">💡 Identifying common mistakes&lt;/h4>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Often introspection is all this one takes. If you&amp;rsquo;re honest with yourself, you probably already know what the &amp;ldquo;hole where all the success leaks out&amp;rdquo; is. Maybe:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>you give up on projects or learning new skills way too quickly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>you&amp;rsquo;re routinely sucked in by your phone or social media and lose hours&lt;/li>
&lt;li>you don&amp;rsquo;t get enough sleep, and fixing it would make you much more productive&lt;/li>
&lt;li>you don&amp;rsquo;t ask for help, and all your projects take much longer as a result&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pretty much all the above apply to me (I&amp;rsquo;m working on it!). Fixing even one of them could make you dramatically more productive without much effort.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="deep-work">Deep work&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Deep work seems to be one of the most important meta-skills to learn as a programmer (or indeed as a knowledge worker).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Deep work is Cal Newport&amp;rsquo;s name for focused, complex work. &lt;em>Learning skills&lt;/em> and &lt;em>deliberate practice&lt;/em> are both examples of deep work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Shallow work, by contrast, is the boring, easy stuff that every job requires, but adds almost no value. Replying to emails, checking IMs, scheduling things – these are all straightforward, but aren&amp;rsquo;t really what you&amp;rsquo;re getting paid to do (although if you neglect to do them, you might find yourself not getting paid at all).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Being able to do deep work seems to be a skill that can be learned. If I get anything out of RC, it might be that – a longer attention span, better awareness of my own foibles and tendencies towards distraction, and some rules for getting deep work done.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="-doing-more-deep-work">💡 Doing more deep work&lt;/h4>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Read the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692">book&lt;/a> (or maybe just the &lt;a href="https://www.samuelthomasdavies.com/book-summaries/business/deep-work/">summary&lt;/a>).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I&amp;rsquo;ve found using the pomodoro technique to be very useful – it gives your day a certain rhythm, and it&amp;rsquo;s very motivating to see the deep work rack up!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Develop a deep work schedule
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>At RC, I try to get in around 10am and do 2–3 hours of deep work before lunch.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In &lt;a href="https://azeria-labs.com/the-importance-of-deep-work-the-30-hour-method-for-learning-a-new-skill/">this amazing post&lt;/a>, Maria &amp;lsquo;Azeria&amp;rsquo; Markstedter recommends dedicating 30 deep work hours (seven four-hour sessions) to a subject at a minimum. It&amp;rsquo;s too easy to give up after one or two hours before you really know if you like the subject or not; that up-front commitment can be very motivating.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Start viewing willpower as a resource that can be depleted, and make sure you aren&amp;rsquo;t wasting it on trivial things.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>switch your phone off so you won&amp;rsquo;t be tempted to check it&lt;/li>
&lt;li>close distracting apps on your laptop (like IM, mail, social media clients)&lt;/li>

&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacing_effect">spacing effect&lt;/a> shows that the most efficient way to learn material is to expose yourself to it at increasing intervals, instead of cramming. Spaced repetition learning uses this effect to show you flashcards at intervals optimised for knowledge retention.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is especially good for learning languages – it&amp;rsquo;s how &lt;a href="http://duolingo.com">Duolingo&lt;/a> decides when to show you old vocabulary to review. So why not use it for learning programming languages as well?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Gwern has written an &lt;a href="https://www.gwern.net/Spaced-repetition#using-it">excellent review of the spacing effect and spaced repetition learning&lt;/a>. He proposes this heuristic for when to commit knowledge to a flashcard:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>[D]on’t use spaced repetition if you need it sooner than 5 days or [knowing it by heart will save] less than 5 minutes.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s likely that most language features and structures are going to net you more than 5 minutes saved. Weird corner cases, little-used syntax used to impress your friends, and extremely straightforward facts about a language might not be so useful.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-it-works">How it works&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Skip this section if you&amp;rsquo;re already familiar with spaced repetition flashcards and want to get to the how-to.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In massed repetition (think cramming for a vocabulary test in French class), you might make a flashcard with two sides, like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code> FRONT REVERSE
[ an apple ] [ une pomme ]
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>You&amp;rsquo;d show one side of the card, try and recall the answer, and then flip it over to see if you got it right. Then you&amp;rsquo;d repeat a bunch more times until it &amp;ldquo;stuck&amp;rdquo;, and after your test, would probably never look at the card again. This process of &lt;em>active recall&lt;/em> strengthens the memory beyond what you&amp;rsquo;d get if you just flicked through the flashcards without thinking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Spaced repetition is a bit different: you still have to challenge yourself to recall the answer, but you then put the card away and look at it again in a few minutes. After the second review, you look at it again in a few hours – and then a couple days, and then a week, and then a month, until the next review is several years away.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Early practitioners of the learning style managed this spacing manually, but &lt;a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html#introduction">software exists&lt;/a> that will do it automatically, and adjust the spacing depending on how difficult you find a particular card.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some facts are also really two entries: in this case, &lt;em>apple : pomme&lt;/em> and &lt;em>pomme : apple&lt;/em> are separate facts. Again, spaced repetition software will &lt;a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html#reverse-cards">treat them as separate cards&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Spaced repetition learning only requires a few minutes a day (and exponentially less as the repetitions get further and further apart!), but it does require consistency. If you make it a habit, though, a couple of minutes per fact and you can retain it literally for years.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="making-cards">Making cards&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m brushing up on my &lt;a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/documentation.html">Rust&lt;/a>. Here&amp;rsquo;s how I made flashcards to help remember what I&amp;rsquo;d done:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Download &lt;a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki&lt;/a>. I&amp;rsquo;ve already been using this for a while; there&amp;rsquo;s also an &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ankimobile-flashcards/id373493387?mt=8">iOS app&lt;/a> (paid) and an &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ichi2.anki&amp;amp;hl=en_US">Android app&lt;/a> (free).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Install the &lt;a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/162313389">Power Format Pack&lt;/a>, which gives you Markdown formatting.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create a new deck (or use the default one, and use tags to subdivide your cards).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Make your first card! Here&amp;rsquo;s a simple example:
&lt;img src="https://henrystanley.com/images/anki-add-card.png" alt="">
Make sure to hit the Markdown render button (the rightmost button in the format panel) to render the card (⌘⇧0 on a Mac), and then save the card (⌘↵).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The &amp;lsquo;Basic&amp;rsquo; card type is fine. You can also use &amp;lsquo;Basic (and reversed card)&amp;rsquo; if you want Anki to generate a reverse card (in this case, one that asks &lt;code>println!&lt;/code> and expects you to answer &amp;ldquo;macro that prints text to the console&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="reviewing">Reviewing&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Okay - you&amp;rsquo;ve added some cards, so now it&amp;rsquo;s time to study them. Click on your deck, then on &amp;ldquo;Study Now&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://henrystanley.com/images/anki-review.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Try to recall the answer, then hit space to reveal:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://henrystanley.com/images/anki-answer.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now grade your response using the buttons provided (they&amp;rsquo;re also mapped to the number keys for speed), or hit space to accept the default.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://henrystanley.com/images/anki-done.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sweet, we&amp;rsquo;re done for today. Come back tomorrow and do the same again. If you&amp;rsquo;ve added lots of cards, Anki will drip-feed them to you over the course of a few days.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-long-term">The long term&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As you may have guessed, this is a long-term, incremental (but very efficient) approach to learning. Instead of cramming and then forgetting, the machine will decide which facts are on the cusp of slipping out of your brain, and challenge you to remember them, greatly strengthening the memory.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But it&amp;rsquo;s a commitment that you need to keep up, ideally for a few months at least. Per card, you&amp;rsquo;ll only ever spend a couple minutes total reviewing it (hence Gwern&amp;rsquo;s recommendation not to bother with facts that you&amp;rsquo;ll spend less than 5 minutes just looking up). And you&amp;rsquo;ll retain near-perfect knowledge of them for decades.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(I&amp;rsquo;ve certainly not been perfect – there have been times when I&amp;rsquo;ve done my Anki reviews daily, and sometimes months go by without me looking at it.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve used this process when learning Ruby, Go, bash, &lt;a href="http://bosh.io">BOSH CLI&lt;/a> commands, &lt;a href="https://www.cloudfoundry.org/">Cloud Foundry&lt;/a> concepts and various other (spoken) languages. Give it a try.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>BitTorrent clients for fun and profit</title><link>https://henrystanley.com/bittorrent-clients-for-fun-and-profit/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 May 2018 16:12:18 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://henrystanley.com/bittorrent-clients-for-fun-and-profit/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;em>This is a work in progress.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;hellip;well, not really for profit. The world doesn&amp;rsquo;t need another BitTorrent client. But it&amp;rsquo;s a great project for learning about an interesting web protocol, exploring the networking stack, getting to grips with Wireshark and debugging, and learning how things work.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="reading-a-torrent">Reading a &lt;code>.torrent&lt;/code>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The torrent files you might find somewhere like The Pirate Bay are encoded with &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bencode">bencode&lt;/a> (pronounced &amp;ldquo;B-Encode&amp;rdquo;, but I&amp;rsquo;m still gonna say &amp;ldquo;ben-code&amp;rdquo;), a terse file format for representing a few simple data structures (strings, ints, dicts and lists).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A bencoded file might look like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>dl10:hello dave!d3:foo3:bar4:fizz4:buzzei42eee
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>Tasty. Let&amp;rsquo;s add newlines for effect:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>d
4:info
l
10:hello dave!
d
3:foo3:bar
4:fizz4:buzz
e
i42e
e
e
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>Elements in a bencoded structure have a letter denoting what they are: &lt;code>d&lt;/code> for dicts, &lt;code>l&lt;/code> for lists, &lt;code>i&lt;/code> for ints. All of those are terminated with a trailing &lt;code>e&lt;/code>. Strings are a little different: they start with the length of the string, then a colon, followed by the string itself (e.g. &lt;code>3:foo&lt;/code>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the above example, the root of the structure is a dict with one key (&amp;ldquo;info&amp;rdquo;) whose value is a list containing a string, a dict and an int.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Writing a decoder for this is an interesting exercise in itself; in the end, I used &lt;a href="https://github.com/jackpal/bencode-go">jackpal/bencode-go&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s what a JSON output of this file might look like (I&amp;rsquo;m using a Ubuntu image torrent):&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-json" data-lang="json">{

&lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;#34;info&amp;#34;&lt;/span>: {
&lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;#34;length&amp;#34;&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">1921843200&lt;/span>,

&lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;#34;pieces&amp;#34;&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;\ufffd &amp;lt;truncated&amp;gt; \ufffd&amp;#34;&lt;/span>
}
}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h2 id="talk-to-the-tracker">Talk to the tracker&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Next, we need to make a request to the tracker to find some peers to connect to. The tracker URL is in the &amp;ldquo;announce&amp;rdquo; field of the metadata.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When first trying this, I got an HTTP 400 and the following error:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>you sent me garbage - id not of length 20&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Damn. This tracker is so SALTY.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Making a correct request to the tracker requires URL-encoding a bunch of params, including a SHA1 hash of the bencoded &amp;ldquo;info&amp;rdquo; section of the torrent metadata. The flow looks something like:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>de-bencode torrent metadata&lt;/li>
&lt;li>extract the &amp;ldquo;announce&amp;rdquo; address&lt;/li>
&lt;li>re-bencode the &amp;ldquo;info&amp;rdquo; block&lt;/li>
&lt;li>generate a random 20-byte peer ID:&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-golang" data-lang="golang">&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">func&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">newClientID&lt;/span>() []&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">byte&lt;/span> {
&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">clientID&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">:=&lt;/span> make([]&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">byte&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">20&lt;/span>)
&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">rand&lt;/span>.&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">Read&lt;/span>(&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">clientID&lt;/span>)
&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">return&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">clientID&lt;/span>
}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;ol>
&lt;li>make a GET request to the announce URL with a bunch of query params:&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>&amp;quot;info_hash&amp;quot;: &amp;lt;bencoded, hashed &amp;quot;info&amp;quot; block&amp;gt;
&amp;quot;peer_id&amp;quot;: &amp;lt;unique peer ID&amp;gt;
&amp;quot;port&amp;quot;: &amp;lt;port you're listening for connection on&amp;gt;
&amp;quot;uploaded&amp;quot;: &amp;lt;number of bytes uploaded&amp;gt;
&amp;quot;left&amp;quot;: &amp;lt;number of bytes left to download&amp;gt;
&amp;quot;compact&amp;quot;: &amp;lt;1 if using compact mode&amp;gt;
&amp;quot;event&amp;quot;: &amp;lt;one of 'started', 'completed', or 'stopped'&amp;gt;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;ol>
&lt;li>de-bencode the response from the tracker, which contains a list of peers in the torrent swarm.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="handshaking-with-peers">Handshaking with peers&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Next, we have to handshake with some subset of the peers the tracker has told us about.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We open a TCP connection to the peer, and send the following message:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://henrystanley.com/images/bittorrent_handshake.jpg" alt="Peer handshake message">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Turns out the satellites that power &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridium_satellite_constellation">Iridium satphones&lt;/a>, beloved of supervillains and Jack Bauer alike, have an interesting feature: their antennas are arranged such that, as they orbit the earth, they briefly reflect sunlight down to us.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ideonexus/2188119372/">&lt;img src="https://henrystanley.com/images/iridium_satellite.jpg" alt="Picture of an Iridium satellite – Ryan Somma">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The three enormous reflective antennas, set at 120 degrees around the body of the satellite, point towards Earth like the head of an arrow. When the satellite passes perpendicular to the sun, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_flare#Iridium_flares">it reflects a bright burst of light at the Earth&amp;rsquo;s surface&lt;/a>. As the position of the satellites is controlled, it&amp;rsquo;s possible to accurately predict when these flashes will appear.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sadly, the Iridium constellation is being replaced with newer satellites whose &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17129473">antennas don&amp;rsquo;t cause flares&lt;/a>. As this happens, and as the older satellites are allowed to drift out of their controlled orbits, the flares will become less and less regular before stopping altogether. Some observers have &lt;a href="https://www.heavens-above.com/IridiumDemise.aspx">already noted&lt;/a> that flares aren&amp;rsquo;t happening as predicted, suggesting some of these satellites have already been &amp;ldquo;de-orbited&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So: get your smartphone, download &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sky-guide-ar/id576588894?mt=8">Sky Guide&lt;/a> (iOS) or &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.runar.issdetector&amp;amp;hl=en_US">ISS Detector&lt;/a> (Android), and get notified of upcoming satellite flares. This might be the end of the rare period where we can watch the sun glint off some sedan-sized chunks of metal we put 485 miles in the sky.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to improve EA Funds</title><link>https://henrystanley.com/how-to-improve-ea-funds/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Apr 2018 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://henrystanley.com/how-to-improve-ea-funds/</guid><description>
&lt;p>I think &lt;a href="https://app.effectivealtruism.org/funds">EA Funds&lt;/a> is an awesome idea – delegate the hard work of deciding where to give money to the experts. I&amp;rsquo;ve donated there in the past, and encouraged others to do so, and I’m glad CEA is putting time into the programme.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, there are some issues with the way the funds are run. My concerns summarised:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The funds hand out money very infrequently&lt;/strong>, and hold onto money for long periods of time. This erodes the value of the fund through time discounting. EA orgs have stated that they value donations in a year&amp;rsquo;s time at a 12% discount to receiving them now&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, so this represents a substantial cost.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The funds hold their money as cash&lt;/strong>, forgoing any potential interest the money could earn.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>There is no schedule as to when the money will be handed out.&lt;/strong> This lack of transparency is troubling, and prevents donors making informed choices (e.g. to give directly to charities instead of waiting).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>(a weaker objection) As the funds hold onto donations for so long, &lt;strong>the chances of the fund manager&amp;rsquo;s and donors’ intentions drifting apart is high&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>My suggested improvements:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Disburse funds regularly (e.g. once every three months).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If they’re not being disbursed, hold funds in low-risk investments (e.g. government bonds), not cash.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Be transparent about future plans and realistic about fund managers’ capacity to administer the fund.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="waiting-to-hand-out-money-erodes-its-value--so-disburse-at-a-regular-cadence">Waiting to hand out money erodes its value – so disburse at a regular cadence&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>EA Funds currently holds $1.1million in cash. From the EA Funds website, here is the amount of money unallocated in each fund, followed by the percentage of the total donations that fund has received which remain unallocated (thanks to Peter Hurford for the idea):&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Global Development: $497,957 [49% of all money it has ever received]&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Long-Term Future: $348,167 [95%]&lt;/li>
&lt;li>EA Community: $206,271 [71%]&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Animal Welfare: $75,109 [18%] – though it&amp;rsquo;s about to make a disbursement&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>EA organisations surveyed at the end of 2017 said their average discount rate on donations was 12% per year&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> – so the funds holding onto donations instead of handing them out has a considerable cost. Whether this discount rate is accurate is another question – given the relative abundance of cash available to EA orgs (through OpenPhil and Good Ventures), a rate as high as this is surprising.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="funds-are-held-as-cash--invest-them-if-theyre-not-being-disbursed">Funds are held as cash – invest them if they’re not being disbursed&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve confirmed with CEA that the money in the funds is held as cash, and not invested. If it was held in e.g. US Treasury bonds, it could be earning 1~2% per year at no risk&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Keeping the funds liquid does have benefits – namely, allowing fund managers to make disbursements at short notice – but I don’t foresee that option being exercised often. I also admit that it isn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;free&amp;rdquo; to invest the money in bond, in that there&amp;rsquo;s operational overhead involved, but with such a large amount of money held it seems worthwhile.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="a-lack-of-transparency-is-bad--be-clear-about-fund-manager-bandwidth">A lack of transparency is bad – be clear about fund manager bandwidth&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It seems like the irregular disbursements from the funds are down largely to fund managers not having sufficient time on their hands – and having much more pressing commitments (e.g. managing big chunks of Open Phil’s budget!).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The funds could take a similar approach to Giving What We Can – allocate funds to the top charities in their cause area, and donate to those charities on a regular basis until the fund manager comes along and updates the allocation. This would prevent funds from sitting in limbo for long periods of time, and ideally would mirror what donors would otherwise be doing with the money if EA Funds didn’t exist (i.e. in the absence of any other information, give to the top charities).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(Of course, this is moot if fund managers have a good reason to defer donating – rather than simply not having the time to manage the fund.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Additionally, the longer the fund holds on to donations, the more likely it is for the donor&amp;rsquo;s intention and the fund&amp;rsquo;s direction to diverge (I wrote more about this &lt;a href="http://effective-altruism.com/ea/1k9/ea_funds_hands_out_money_very_infrequently_should/d8l">here&lt;/a>). You could argue that this is already happening: when I donate to a fund, I do so in the expectation that the money will be handed out reasonably rapidly.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Uber ban is bad news.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I know more than one person with a disability or chronic illness who relies on Uber – to see friends, to get to work, to get to medical appointments. Those people are literally only able to get around using Uber. They lose a lifeline if Uber is gone, as do thousands of drivers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Uber also saves lives. &lt;a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2783797">Research by Dills and Mulholland&lt;/a> finds that the rate of vehicle accidents, assaults and public order offences drops considerably when Uber enters a city.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Transport for London could have demanded reforms if it wanted to. Instead, it gave Uber one minute&amp;rsquo;s notice of the decision before going public with it. &lt;a href="https://blog.taxify.eu/2017/09/bringing-fairer-ride-hailing-to-london/">Other companies&lt;/a> have tried to bring innovation to London&amp;rsquo;s taxi market and been brought to their knees by TfL&amp;rsquo;s vindictiveness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To some extent I think their flouting of the rules has been a good thing. I was surprised that the LTDA lost a case against them &lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/transport/11935513/uber-minicabs-high-court-ruling-victory-london.html">alleging that Uber uses the driver&amp;rsquo;s mobile phone as a taximeter&lt;/a> (which it clearly does!) – but it&amp;rsquo;s totally changed the shape of the market, and I believe for the better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve seen plenty of people enjoy watching Uber squirm. I look forward to hearing what they&amp;rsquo;re proposing should fill the gap – but given that nothing similar existed before Uber, it&amp;rsquo;s not clear that anything will.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>TfL hasn&amp;rsquo;t given out much information on the decision, but they mention:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Uber&amp;rsquo;s use of Greyball in London – &lt;a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/uber-exec-we-didnt-use-greyball-to-evade-uk-regulators-2017-9">an independent review has already found that they didn&amp;rsquo;t use it&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Uber&amp;rsquo;s approach to DBS checks – which are done by a government-owned company, as part of individuals getting a private hire licence, so not clear what Uber has to do with it&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Uber&amp;rsquo;s approach to medical checks – doctors were accepting bribes to give drivers a clean bill of health, but they were &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/1897962/investigation-reveals-dodgy-gps-getting-cash-to-help-minicab-and-uber-drivers-fake-medical-test-over-fitness-to-drive/">doing the same for other minicab firms&lt;/a>, and again I don&amp;rsquo;t see how it&amp;rsquo;s Uber&amp;rsquo;s problem (any more than me going to the doctor and paying for a forged sick note to play hookey)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Uber&amp;rsquo;s approach to reporting criminal offices – which is definitely awful (and far too slow), but there only seems to be a &lt;a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/met-police-letter-uber-doesnt-report-serious-crimes-2017-8">single case of them failing to report a serious assault to the police&lt;/a>, the other one involving a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/aug/13/uber-failing-to-report-sex-attacks-by-drivers-says-met-police">legal self-defence dye spray, not pepper spray&lt;/a> as the Met alleged&lt;/li>

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m impressed at how slick Effective Altruism has become.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I arrived at Oxford&amp;rsquo;s Examination Schools for &lt;a href="https://www.eaglobal.org/events/eagx-oxford-2016/">EAGxOxford 2016&lt;/a>, a greeter gave me a plastic name badge, a T-shirt and &amp;ldquo;a copy of Will&amp;rsquo;s book&amp;rdquo;. (You do know who &lt;a href="http://www.williammacaskill.com/">Will MacAskill&lt;/a> is, right?) I headed into the South Schools, which was dark except for a white fill lighting up the stage. The two co-organisers of the conference ran on stage, wearing headset mics, to cheers and applause. They gave a brief introduction, before yielding to Will MacAskill and Toby Ord, who each gave a sort of &amp;lsquo;state of the nation&amp;rsquo; summary of where the movement began and where it had got to.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was pretty cool. The branding was on point, the event was insanely well-organised (especially considering it was run solely by students) &amp;ndash; even the process of asking questions (submitting them using a web app and voting on them in real time) was better than at any conference I&amp;rsquo;ve been to before.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And EA is growing up. More than 2,000 people have taken the &lt;a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge/">Giving What We Can&lt;/a> pledge (that&amp;rsquo;s an estimated $1bn in pledges). MacAskill said that &amp;ldquo;in 2016, it felt like effective altruism became a real thing for the first time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unlike most conferences, everyone was very happy to meet new people, going out of their way to make friends and have challenging conversations. I eavesdropped on someone explaining a utilitarian approach to animal welfare &amp;ndash; that even if we weight animals' suffering considerably lower than humans' (for whatever reason), the sheer number of animals raised and slaughtered in industry means we ought to be concerned about them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not your usual water cooler chat, then. You&amp;rsquo;d often get asked what your &amp;ldquo;cause area&amp;rdquo; was: that is, are you focusing on ending global poverty, improving animal welfare, reducing existential risks&amp;hellip;? It was pretty inspiring to be in a room full of friendly, smart, utilitarians. It made me rethink some of my choices and priorities. And it made me want to do more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Going to this was was one of the best things I did all year. To any shy EAs hesitating about attending one of these: go. Meet your people.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to BOSH</title><link>https://henrystanley.com/how-to-bosh/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Nov 2016 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://henrystanley.com/how-to-bosh/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>(This is a work in progress. Let me know your thoughts.)&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://bosh.io">BOSH&lt;/a> is a set of tools &amp;ndash; a &lt;strong>CLI&lt;/strong>, a &lt;strong>server (&amp;ldquo;Director&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/strong> and an &lt;strong>agent&lt;/strong> &amp;ndash; that together let you deploy collections of virtual machines to the cloud. You can deploy on a bunch of different cloud providers: Amazon Web Services, Google Compute Platform, Microsoft Azure and more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s notable because it&amp;rsquo;s the &lt;em>de facto&lt;/em> deployment tool for &lt;a href="http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/overview.html">Cloud Foundry&lt;/a>, the open-source platform-as-a-service.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Give BOSH a &lt;strong>manifest&lt;/strong> (a YAML file detailing what machines you want deployed, how they should be networked, and what code they should run) and BOSH will make it so.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If something happens to one of your VMs, BOSH will recreate it automatically. Change the manifest and re-deploy, and BOSH will change only what&amp;rsquo;s needed to get to the desired state. Point to a different cloud, and BOSH will deploy that same set of machines identically.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>BOSH is a &lt;em>converger&lt;/em>: it will work to converge your VMs to the correct configuration.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="director">Director&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the &lt;a href="https://bosh.io/docs/bosh-components.html#director">Director&lt;/a> &amp;ndash; the beating heart of BOSH. This is just a regular VM deployed to your cloud of choice. It talks to that cloud, and is able to create and destroy VMs, persistent disks, assign IPs and basically do everything you&amp;rsquo;d otherwise have to do manually.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But&amp;hellip; how do you deploy a Director? The fastest way is to use &lt;a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-bootloader">bosh-bootloader&lt;/a>.&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> Once that&amp;rsquo;s done, we have a Director, ready to deploy VMs:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">&lt;span style="color:#f92672">+---------------+&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#f92672">|&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">BOSH&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">Director&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">|&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#f92672">+---------------+&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;h2 id="jobs">Jobs&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The smallest unit of a BOSH deployment is the &lt;strong>job&lt;/strong>. This might be something like &lt;a href="http://redis.io">Redis&lt;/a>, a key-value datastore. This job is packaged up, possibly with other jobs, into a &lt;strong>release&lt;/strong>. Once you have some releases, you can compose the jobs within into a deployment in any way you choose. This is part of the power of BOSH.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s our &lt;code>redis-server&lt;/code> job:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">&lt;span style="color:#f92672">+----------------------------+&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#f92672">|&lt;/span> redis&lt;span style="color:#f92672">-&lt;/span>server &lt;span style="color:#f92672">|&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;lt;---&lt;/span> job
&lt;span style="color:#f92672">|&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">|&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#f92672">+----&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">PRESTART&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">---&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">CTL&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">---&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">DRAIN&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">--+&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>&lt;code>pre-start&lt;/code>, &lt;code>ctl&lt;/code> and &lt;code>drain&lt;/code> are scripts that the job has that BOSH uses to prepare it for starting, start it up, and shut it down respectively.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Okay, we want BOSH to get Redis running for us. A job isn&amp;rsquo;t enough for that &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s just a collection of scripts that BOSH knows how to run. To get it going, that job needs to be put on an &lt;strong>instance&lt;/strong> &amp;ndash; an actual VM that BOSH will spin up for us.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="deployments">Deployments&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We can put together a simple manifest for this kind of &lt;strong>deployment&lt;/strong>:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml">---
&lt;span style="color:#f92672">name&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">my-cool-redis&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#f92672">releases&lt;/span>:
- &lt;span style="color:#f92672">name&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">redis-release&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#f92672">version&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">1&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#f92672">instance_groups&lt;/span>:
- &lt;span style="color:#f92672">name&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">redis&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#f92672">instances&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">1&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#f92672">jobs&lt;/span>:
- &lt;span style="color:#f92672">name&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">redis-server&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#f92672">release&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">redis-release&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#f92672">networks&lt;/span>:
- &lt;span style="color:#f92672">name&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">default&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>And, once we run &lt;code>bosh deploy&lt;/code> on our local machine, BOSH will tell the Director to deploy our lone Redis machine.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">&lt;span style="color:#f92672">+--------------------------------+&lt;/span>

&lt;span style="color:#f92672">|&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">+----------------------------+&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">|&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#f92672">|&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">|&lt;/span> redis&lt;span style="color:#f92672">-&lt;/span>server &lt;span style="color:#f92672">|&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">|&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#f92672">|&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">|&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">|&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">|&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#f92672">|&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">+----&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">PRESTART&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">---&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">CTL&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">---&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">DRAIN&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">--+&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">|&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#f92672">|&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">|&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#f92672">|&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">+----------------------------+&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">|&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#f92672">|&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">|&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">BOSH&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">Agent&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">|&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">|&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#f92672">|&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">+----------------------------+&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">|&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#f92672">+===========+====================+&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#f92672">|&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#f92672">+-----------+---+&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#f92672">|&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">BOSH&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">Director&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">|&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#f92672">+---------------+&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Nice! We now have one VM running on our platform of choice, and that VM is running Redis. If Redis misbehaves, the Agent, also running on the VM, will restart it (using &lt;a href="https://mmonit.com/monit/">monit&lt;/a> under the hood for process management). And if the VM dies or disconnects from the Director, then the Director will redeploy it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If we want to scale out our deployment a bit, we can just make a small change to our manifest to indicate that we want two instances of our &lt;code>redis&lt;/code> instance group.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml">&lt;span style="color:#f92672">instance_groups&lt;/span>:
- &lt;span style="color:#f92672">name&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">redis&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#f92672">instances&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">2&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>and redeploy:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">&lt;span style="color:#f92672">+--------------------------------+&lt;/span>

Notice that each instance has a &lt;em>name&lt;/em> (&lt;code>redis&lt;/code>) and an &lt;em>index&lt;/em> (&lt;code>0&lt;/code>) which allows it to be uniquely identified in a deployment. And say we have a &lt;code>redis-metrics&lt;/code> job that collects some usage data about our Redis &amp;ndash; we can &lt;em>co-locate&lt;/em> that job onto our instances with a single change:&lt;/p>

&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;h2 id="marrakech">Marrakech&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;em>2 nights at Riad Aguerzame; 1 night at Riad Miski.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://henrystanley.com/images/riad-marrakech.jpg">&lt;img src="https://henrystanley.com/images/riad-marrakech.jpg" alt="Riad Aguerzame">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our arrival was bad. Ripped off by rude taxi drivers, taken the long way round the city, and then taken to the wrong place down terrifying streets (think pitch black corners and ceilings you need to crouch to get under). We eventually found our &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moroccan_riad">riad&lt;/a>. “Oh, we&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to call to see if the driver found you,” said our host. We forgot we were being picked up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Marrakshis have two sides: the kind you meet out and about, and the kind inside. Inside, in shops and cafes and riads, people are charming and friendly. But outside, on the streets of the medina, people will lie through their teeth to get money out of you. “Big square is this way.” (It wasn&amp;rsquo;t.) “That way is closed.” (It isn&amp;rsquo;t.) “Fuck you” when you don&amp;rsquo;t reply, hoping to get a rise out of you – then they know you speak English and can palm you off on one of their friends. It&amp;rsquo;s not a friendly place. Plan your route before you leave your riad &amp;ndash; which will become an quiet oasis in the médina.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are some beautiful, historic sites in the médina, like the Ben Youssef madrasa.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://henrystanley.com/images/ben-youssef.jpg">&lt;img src="https://henrystanley.com/images/ben-youssef.jpg" alt="Ben Youssef madrasa">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The souks were of little interest. Everyone sells the same glazed tagines, tea sets and leather goods. Seeing first-hand the cruelty involved in their sale &amp;ndash; emaciated donkeys, whipped and laden with boxes in the scorching heat &amp;ndash; was awful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Marrakech has a quieter side that shows its face on Sunday. Less harassment from street touts, fewer people in the streets. It made being out pleasant again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Everyone talks about the Majorelle gardens: famed for their electric-blue paintwork. The cactus garden was full of exotic species and was beautiful as well. The cafe was a nice place to drink &lt;em>café allongé&lt;/em> and people-watch – lots of beautiful Spanish and French girls, tattooed and elegantly dressed despite the heat. Maybe more impressive was &lt;em>Le Jardin Secret&lt;/em>, a riad which had been remade as two beautiful gardens, with a focus on maintaining much of the existing pre-industrial irrigation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Go day-tripping to the Atlas Mountains. Wear your seatbelt if you don&amp;rsquo;t want the police to stop you and fine you. (Needless to say, this isn&amp;rsquo;t about safety &amp;ndash; none of the taxis have working seatbelts.) We had traditional Moroccan lunch, cooked by a Berber family, in a valley 2000m above sea level.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://henrystanley.com/images/atlas-mountains.jpg">&lt;img src="https://henrystanley.com/images/atlas-mountains.jpg" alt="Atlas mountains">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="rabat">Rabat&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;em>1 night at Riad Marhaba.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A quiet, cool seaside city. People talked to me on the street &amp;ndash; this time out of curiosity. One man told me about his work running a naturalisation centre for migrants to Morocco, teaching them Arabic and inculcating them with the culture.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The drive was insane. In the city, drivers are mad, frantically overtaking and undertaking. The motorways were much better &amp;ndash; paved to an impeccable standard and paid for with tolls &amp;ndash; but the driving left a lot to be desired. A bus had broken down and was sat in a slip lane; a couple of guys were leaning against it (in the road!) smoking cigarettes. People picking up litter will dart across the carriageway without warning. And indicating was more of an art than a science.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We wandered to the beach in search of a jetski. A surf instructor pointed us to a place down the other end of the beach, seemingly without wanting to sell his own services. He offered us his business card in case we changed our minds. &amp;ldquo;Where are you from?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;From London. You?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;From Rabat. But wherever there is air to breathe, I am home.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://henrystanley.com/images/rabat-beachfront.jpg">&lt;img src="https://henrystanley.com/images/rabat-beachfront.jpg" alt="Rabat beachfront">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the end, unable to find a jetski to hire in our budget, we went paddleboarding. After fucking up our approach into the water a few times and capsizing, a local pointed out that we were in the wrong part of the beach &amp;ndash; that the waves were much smaller if we moved along a bit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The riad owner is French; working for Alstom on power plants in Casablanca (previously he was in Algeria). He much prefers Rabat to other cities in Morocco. Thinks it&amp;rsquo;s underrated. He&amp;rsquo;s right. Rabat is more like a city in the south of France – calm, patisseries on every corner, and a beautiful seafront.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://henrystanley.com/images/rabat-mausoleum.jpg">&lt;img src="https://henrystanley.com/images/rabat-mausoleum.jpg" alt="Mausoleum of Mohammed V">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="fez">Fez&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;em>3 nights at Riad Andalib.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The owner of Riad Andalib is no-nonsense. He gave us the lowdown on how to enjoy Fez without a guide. For haggling on offers in the souk, push for a 70% price cut. For big items like carpets, push for 90%.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Use basic economic theory to your advantage. A taxi driver taking people from the médina to the new town can carry three passengers at 5Dh each; if you offer 15Dh they&amp;rsquo;ll take you. Maybe 20Dh if you don&amp;rsquo;t want them to wait around for other passengers. Insist on giving the correct money at the end of your ride. One driver insisted on getting 15Dh from each of us &amp;ndash; when I noted, sharply, that &lt;em>&lt;a href="https://translate.google.com/#fr/en/j'ai%20dit%20quinze%20pour%20tous%20les%20deux">j&amp;rsquo;ai dit quinze pour tous les deux&lt;/a>&lt;/em>, he was silent.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The new town offered some novelties. A huge Carrefour supermarket &amp;ndash; big enough that you could buy a moped there. A Virgin Megastore. A frozen yogurt place (Hector pointed out we&amp;rsquo;ve now consumed froyo on three continents).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Probably the highlight of our trip was a tour round the once-great El Glaoui palace. The woman who showed us round knew it inside and out, and its history, and she lived there with her husband, himself a distant relative of some Moroccan nobleman.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://henrystanley.com/images/el-glaoui.jpg">&lt;img src="https://henrystanley.com/images/el-glaoui.jpg" alt="Palais El Glaoui">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The place was disintegrating. Ornate balustrades had collapsed to rubble; a lonely black cat picked at the grout between the mosaic tiles. It was haunting and amazing.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="_retour_">&lt;em>Retour&lt;/em>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Marrakesh airport is dire. Getting airside takes an hour and ten minutes. Mobile boarding passes don&amp;rsquo;t work, so we have to pick up paper ones. Security takes twenty minutes or so, and the liquids policy is variably enforced. (Hector is forced to surrender his sunscreen, but I get away with mine.) There are blaring announcements every minute or so &amp;ndash; bring noise-cancelling headphones.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Being home is strange, but nice. Comforting. Britain is a calmer place. Things work here. The sound of sirens is nice - in Morocco, you never hear sirens. And such a relief to be able to walk down the street unhassled&amp;hellip;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Brexit: the next step</title><link>https://henrystanley.com/brexit-the-next-step/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jun 2016 18:07:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://henrystanley.com/brexit-the-next-step/</guid><description>
&lt;p>The Economist &lt;a href="http://www.economist.com/news/britain/21700386-brexiteers-are-deliberately-vague-about-alternatives-european-union-membership">lays out&lt;/a> what Britain would look like as an EEA member.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This seems the most likely option to me, but has some interesting caveats: all other EEA members are part of the Schengen area (which Britain isn&amp;rsquo;t currently) and make significant contributions to the EU&amp;rsquo;s budget. We presumably would have to do the same. I hope we do. Freedom of movement between member states is one of the most beautiful parts of the EU, and an inspiring piece of supranational engineering. Friends of mine are already talking about relocating to Barcelona or Berlin to make the most of it. Maybe I should do the same.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m obviously bitterly disappointed at our nation&amp;rsquo;s choice to leave. Of the hate-filled and deceitful campaigning, my father said: &amp;ldquo;the liars won.&amp;rdquo; Of course, the result reveals a country riven in two, and a disenfranchised electorate looking to stick up two fingers at Westminster. And rarely does a catastrophe have a single root cause: here it was not just the misinformation fed to the public, but worsening prospects for the working class, a totally ineffectual Labour campaign for a remain vote, torrential flooding on polling day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A &lt;a href="http://indy100.independent.co.uk/article/everyone-is-sharing-this-mournful-brexit-comment-from-the-ft-comments-section--ZypvDIKnVW">commenter in the FT&lt;/a> summed up my sadness on Friday best:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>[The] younger generation has lost the right to live and work in 27 other countries. We will never know the full extent of the lost opportunities, friendships, marriages and experiences we will be denied. Freedom of movement was taken away by our parents, uncles, and grandparents in a parting blow to a generation that was already drowning in the debts of our predecessors.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I remember saving aggressively to fund a summer backpacking trip to Europe in 1998, on a shoestring budget (which I bragged about for years after). Then there were the years and years of road trips, short and long, criss-crossing the US multiple times. Those were good times. Peacefully lost wandering times.

&lt;p>How we spend our days is, of course, how we spend our lives. What we do with this hour, and that one, is what we are doing. A schedule defends from chaos and whim. It is a net for catching days. It is a scaffolding on which a worker can stand and labor with both hands at sections of time. A schedule is a mock-up of reason and order—willed, faked, and so brought into being; it is a peace and a haven set into the wreck of time; it is a lifeboat on which you find yourself, decades later, still living.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Stack Overflow released their latest &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016">annual developer survey&lt;/a> last month. (For any non-programmers reading: Stack Overflow is a website where you can ask questions about programming. For many programming problems, the answer will already be up there. It&amp;rsquo;s an amazing resource that almost everyone in the industry uses.) A few key points stood out for me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016#developer-profile-education">Education&lt;/a>: 43% of programmers have a BA or BS in Computer Science or a related field.&lt;/strong> This is a much smaller number than I would have guessed. It&amp;rsquo;s amazing to think that most programmers don&amp;rsquo;t have a CS degree. The survey methodology has changed from last year, when respondents could only pick one option for their education, Maybe I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be so surprised. During a recent retrospective at Pivotal, I noted that of the handful of people in the room, most either had a degree in a non-CS subject or didn&amp;rsquo;t have a degree at all.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve suffered from insomnia for as long as I can remember – certainly since I was a teenager. Melatonin has provided some relief, putting me to sleep more quickly and deeply. It&amp;rsquo;s safe to use daily for up to three months; more research is needed on long-term use.&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> Melatonin is a tricky to obtain: it&amp;rsquo;s not available in the UK, though you can buy it over-the-counter in the US (and can &lt;a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-az/medicines-why-are-some-not-available-in-the-uk-762721.html">import it into the UK&lt;/a>). My summary:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>the most effective dose is &lt;strong>0.3mg&lt;/strong>&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>taken &lt;strong>1–2 hours before bedtime&lt;/strong>&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Melatonin sold over-the-counter tends to come in very large doses. Buy the lowest dose you can find, likely 1mg, and use a pill cutter to get to the required dose (I take 0.25mg). Gwern has written a &lt;a href="https://www.gwern.net/Melatonin">very comprehensive article on melatonin&lt;/a> for those interested.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>From Will MacAskill&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>&lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23398748-doing-good-better">Doing Good Better&lt;/a>:&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>What the conclusions from the economic studies suggest is that the benefit you would get from having your salary doubled is the same as the benefit an extremely poor Indian farmer earning $220 a year would get from an additional $220. As noted earlier, the typical US wage is $28,000 (£18,200), so there is good theoretical reason for thinking that the same amount of money can be of at least one hundred times as much benefit to the very poorest people in the world as it can be to typical citizens of the West. Anyone earning this much is one hundred times as rich as the very poorest people in the world, which means one additional unit of income can do a hundred times as much to benefit the extreme poor as it can to benefit you or I. &amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The 100x Multiplier should surprise us. We shouldn’t expect to be able to do so much to benefit others at such little cost to ourselves. But we live in an unusual place during an unusual time. It’s an unusual place because, if you’re reading this book then, like me, you’re probably lucky enough to be earning $16,000 (£10,500) per year or more, putting you in the richest 10% of the world’s population. That’s a remarkable situation to be in. It’s an unusual time because it comes after a period of extraordinary economic progress that has led to some of the world experiencing what is, historically, fabulous wealth. &amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>In a mere 200 years, we’ve become thirty times richer. But it is a time following remarkably unequal economic progress. Despite the riches of people like us, there are still billions living in abject poverty. &amp;hellip; few people who have ever existed have had so much power to help others as we have today.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Sometimes we look at the size of the problems in the world and think, ‘Anything I do would be just a drop in the bucket. So why bother?’ But, &amp;hellip; that reasoning doesn’t make any sense. It’s the size of the drop that matters, not the size of the bucket, and, if we choose, we can create an enormous splash.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In Ruby, the &lt;code>pry&lt;/code> gem lets you call &lt;code>binding.pry&lt;/code> in your code. When it runs, you get dropped into a breakpoint. From there, you can play around with variables and methods, just like you would in a REPL.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today I learned what &lt;code>binding&lt;/code> actually is &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s an object containing the current execution context at the point it&amp;rsquo;s called. Effectively, it&amp;rsquo;s a snapshot of the state of the Ruby VM at the time the breakpoint is hit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And now, courtesy of &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/harxy">@harxy&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve finally taken the &lt;a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge/">Giving What We Can​ pledge&lt;/a> – a commitment to give away (at least) 10% of my income to the most effective charities in the world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Amounts of money that are relatively small to us in the developed world can make an enormous difference if applied well. An insecticide-treated mosquito net &lt;a href="http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/amf">costs around $5&lt;/a>. Giving a child a deworming pill to treat schistosomiasis &lt;a href="http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/schistosomiasis-control-initiative">costs a little over a dollar&lt;/a>. Online animal welfare outreach, per dollar, can &lt;a href="http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/research/organizations/mercy-for-animals-review/">spare the lives of 37 farmed animals&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These are highly effective interventions that are outstanding opportunities to do good. On a &amp;lsquo;cost per extra year of life&amp;rsquo; basis, some charities are hundreds of times more effective than others. That&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;m convinced that &amp;lsquo;effective altruism&amp;rsquo; – spending your money on the right kind of charity – is one of the best ways you can change the world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If the average US citizen gave 10% of their income to &lt;a href="https://www.againstmalaria.com/">The Against Malaria Foundation&lt;/a>​, then each year it could distribute 700 mosquito nets, preventing 190 cases of malaria and 2.2 deaths. Over a lifetime, that would amount to saving 90 lives. Real change is possible. You can make a difference.&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>For this year, my wish for each of us is small and very simple. And it&amp;rsquo;s this. I hope that in this year to come, you make mistakes. Because if you are making mistakes, then you are making new things, trying new things, learning, living, pushing yourself, changing yourself, changing your world. You&amp;rsquo;re doing things you&amp;rsquo;ve never done before, and more importantly, you&amp;rsquo;re Doing Something. &amp;hellip;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>My father tells a story of someone he used to work with – someone so totally unacquainted with social norms that he was thought of as &amp;lsquo;an alien&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One day, this man was suggesting some boneheaded idea to his boss. The boss was not impressed with it. The man pressed on: &amp;ldquo;well, gee, you just don&amp;rsquo;t seem to be getting this&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; His boss turned puce and said, threateningly: &amp;ldquo;maybe that&amp;rsquo;s because &lt;em>it&amp;rsquo;s just the wrong idea&lt;/em>.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>It&amp;rsquo;s the wrong idea&lt;/em> is a surprisingly useful concept. Often you&amp;rsquo;ll have gone down a road so far that you&amp;rsquo;re blinded by context. Sometimes taking stock of your general direction can make you realise not that the details of your solution are wrong, but the whole approach. You need to start over.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pair programming is nice for that reason: while you work on the nitty-gritty implementation details, your pair can keep the fifty-thousand foot view in the back of their mind. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to get lost down a rabbit hole; they can remind you why you&amp;rsquo;re going down this path in the first place.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>App icon product placement</title><link>https://henrystanley.com/app-icon-product-placement/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Nov 2015 13:19:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://henrystanley.com/app-icon-product-placement/</guid><description>

&lt;p>_&lt;a href="http://www.raptitude.com/2012/07/most-lives-are-lived-by-default/">Most lives are lived by default_&lt;/a>, on David Cain&amp;rsquo;s blog &lt;em>Raptitude&lt;/em>, is a favourite piece of mine.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The day-to-day feel and quality of each of our lives sits on a few major structures: &lt;strong>where we live, what we do for a living, what we do with ourselves when we’re not at work, and which people we spend most of our time with&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Those four structures – which mostly are handed to us by happenstance – determine the shape of our lives. We choose from the options day-to-day life presents us, but these structures bound those options. Of course, this raises a scary thought: your life is probably sub-optimal. &amp;ldquo;Chances are very slight that there isn’t a drastically better neighborhood for you out there, a more kindred circle of peers, a much better line of work, and a much more rewarding way to go about your day[.]&amp;rdquo; Even worse, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_quo_bias">status quo bias&lt;/a> blinds you to the possibility that some other life might be better for you. But change any of those four structures, and your life changes substantially, too.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>It might get better, or it might get worse. You don’t know until the change is made. This uncertainty is enough to keep most people from bothering. But they should bother, as a rule. … If the new situation does resonate, then you’re closer to finding what’s right for you, what’s optimal for your sense of well-being.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>So change your defaults to change your life. A simple first step: break out of your script and &lt;a href="http://malcolmocean.com/2015/11/just-do-a-thing-nobodys-expecting/">do something that nobody&amp;rsquo;s expecting you to do&lt;/a> – the more un-self-directed, the better.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Concourse: CI as Code</title><link>https://henrystanley.com/concourse-ci-as-code/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Oct 2015 17:33:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://henrystanley.com/concourse-ci-as-code/</guid><description>

The highlights:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Unlike other CI systems, Concourse puts pipelines first.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Everyone has a pipeline of some sort – how automated and well-documented is yours?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A pipeline can be a CI/CD process (build → unit → integration → deploy), but can also be used to e.g. version a resource, push code to Amazon S3 or a BOSH release, and all sorts of other things.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pipelines are made of three components: &lt;a href="http://concourse.ci/concepts.html">pipelines, resources and jobs&lt;/a>. Any pipeline can be described with these primitives.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Concourse stores your entire configuration as YAML. Nothing in the UI is configurable, which means your entire pipeline can be stored under version control, and your Concourse instance can be easily rebuilt.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Concourse integrates beautifully with &lt;a href="https://www.cloudfoundry.org/">Cloud Foundry&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>From &lt;a href="http://nautil.us/issue/29/scaling/life-is-a-braid-in-spacetime-rp">Life Is a Braid in Spacetime&lt;/a> by Max Tegmark:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>When we think about the present, we mean the time slice through spacetime corresponding to the time when we’re having that thought. We refer to the future and past as the parts of spacetime above and below this slice. [Spacetime as a mathematical structure implies a] universe that can be beautifully described by mathematics. That this is true for our universe has become increasingly clear over the centuries, with evidence piling up ever more rapidly. The latest triumph in this area is the discovery of the Higgs boson, which, just like the planet Neptune and the radio wave, was first predicted with a pencil, using mathematical equations. This view of ourselves as &amp;hellip; patterns in spacetime challenges the assumption that we can never understand consciousness. It optimistically suggests that consciousness can one day be understood as a form of matter, a derivative of the most beautifully complex spacetime structure in our universe. Such understanding would enlighten our approaches to animals, unresponsive patients, and future ultra-intelligent machines, with wide-ranging ethical, legal, and technological implications.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Some thoughts on (tech) startups.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Keep it simple.&lt;/strong> Every decision you make needs to have minimalism at its heart. On features: fewer is better. On copy: it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter nearly as much as you think it does. On software: don&amp;rsquo;t reinvent the wheel. Use popular frameworks and don&amp;rsquo;t roll your own code when off-the-shelf will do.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Shipped is better than smart.&lt;/strong> It&amp;rsquo;s easy to get carried away with exotic ideas and interesting code. Resist this urge at all costs. Everything takes so much longer to do than you think it will. Keeping your product feature-light and your code simple will defend against this. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter how crazy secure your custom encryption layer is if you die while building it.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Fear the shadow of the future.&lt;/strong> It&amp;rsquo;s tempting to write bad code, skip testing, ignore design patterns, hack on production, let your codebase grow. But technical debt has to be paid back someday — and the longer you put it off, the bigger the interest gets.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Technology is a tax on scaling&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> —&lt;/strong> so have as little of it as possible. If tumblr is good enough for &lt;a href="http://yahooeng.tumblr.com/">Yahoo!&amp;rsquo;s engineering team&lt;/a>, then you don&amp;rsquo;t need to host your own high-availability, DDoS-protected Wordpress stack. Focus on your product&amp;rsquo;s core features, and don&amp;rsquo;t get distracted by crazy technical setups.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Don&amp;rsquo;t break your own rules.&lt;/strong> If you need to, you&amp;rsquo;re doing something wrong. If you&amp;rsquo;ve said that your developers shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have access to the production database when you go live, don&amp;rsquo;t break that rule later on. The same is true of features: if you&amp;rsquo;ve pared down your roadmap to a single essential product, then don&amp;rsquo;t let feature creep push you off course.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Don&amp;rsquo;t burn yourself out working crazy hours.&lt;/strong> &lt;a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/overtime.html">Set a sustainable, measurable, predictable pace.&lt;/a> If you have to work insane hours to make ends meet, you&amp;rsquo;re doing something wrong — either your code is bad, your product too complicated, or your team under-resourced.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Be wary of growth through sheer force.&lt;/strong> Any product can get users, given enough funding. But if it costs you ten times more to acquire a user then they ever return you in profits, your business model is broken.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Listen to your employees.&lt;/strong> They&amp;rsquo;re the ones at the coal-face working on your product, selling it to people, meeting your customers. They probably know the most about it. They need to care about it and believe in it. Take their opinions seriously.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p> I interpret Zen Buddhism as a set of practices for not tripping over your own mind – avoiding our tendency to bin experiences into categories so swiftly and completely that we stop actually paying attention to them, not becoming imprisoned by fixed beliefs, not mistaking maps for territories, always remaining attentive to what actually is. Perhaps the most elegant expression of this interpretation is this koan setting forth the problem: “The mind is like a dog. His master points at the moon, but he barks at the hand.”&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Not all tech startups are into ping-pong and meditating on beanbags, you know.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This one totally is, though. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have it any other way.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="1">1.&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Two-and-a-bit years in pharmaceutical PR had &lt;a href="https://www.glassdoor.co.uk/Overview/Working-at-Tonic-Life-Communications-EI_IE725076.11,36.htm">left me jaded&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The day-to-day work that could be done by a shell script (or, more likely, just not done at all), endless meetings, useless project management, incompetent clients, Kafkaesque performance reviews, bullying, railroading. Having to use the same piece-of-shit computer &lt;em>every goddamn day&lt;/em>. I wanted things to be done better; no-one wanted to hear it, because doing things better would mean less tedious administrative work, and without &lt;em>that&lt;/em>, how are you supposed to get your junior employees to &amp;lsquo;pay their dues&amp;rsquo;?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Going for &lt;a href="http://www.makersacademy.com">Makers Academy&lt;/a> was a stab in the dark. Was it worth the money? Would I enjoy being a developer? Hobbies often don&amp;rsquo;t translate well into jobs. Just because I&amp;rsquo;ve dicked around with the command line in my script kiddie days doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean I&amp;rsquo;ll enjoy being a professional dev.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some of the work was done for me. &lt;a href="http://www.80000hours.org">80,000 Hours&lt;/a>, a spin-off of the Oxford Future of Humanity Institute that tries to get people to take careers that will do the most good in the world, very kindly offered me a career consultation. We walked through the things I cared about and the options I was considering, did some research, and found that Makers looked like a near-perfect option: it leads to an interesting career that I&amp;rsquo;d likely stick with, with high earning potential as a software engineer (virtually uncapped if you include tech entrepreneurship), plus possible direct altruism through working on social enterprise. I described the course to my father. He&amp;rsquo;s unconvinced that tech is the right endgame – business would be more suited to me, he says. But he called Makers a &amp;ldquo;must do&amp;rdquo;; a no-brainer. Shortly after my entry interview, I signed off the single largest payment I have ever made. And as is often the case with the big life decisions you deliberate over for months, you suddenly wonder: &amp;ldquo;why did I wait so long?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="2">2.&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Makers Academy makes big promises. &amp;ldquo;Learn to code in 12 weeks&amp;rdquo;, shouts their site&amp;rsquo;s strapline. Eccentric and brilliant lecturer &lt;a href="http://ecomba.pro">Enrique&lt;/a> quickly pours cold water on our hopes. &amp;ldquo;Just to check, how many of you think you&amp;rsquo;re going to be awesome developers after twelve weeks?&amp;rdquo; No hands go up. &amp;ldquo;Good! I&amp;rsquo;m glad you&amp;rsquo;re all so realistic.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The course is intense, but the level of effort is normalised by everyone else&amp;rsquo;s resolve, and by the energy of the place. Students and teachers routinely arrive before nine in the morning and leave after seven at night. No-one&amp;rsquo;s commitment is in doubt. Everyone is routinely out of their comfort zone. Everyone is here to work hard, and master a new skill. We are told, repeatedly, to expect to feel stupid, every day, for twelve weeks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That social hack alone – that you get more shit done in a place where you&amp;rsquo;re shoved together with other smart, determined people than teaching yourself from a book or at a distance – makes the course fee worth it. Add to that the structured learning environment, learning from and teach other students, pair programming and one-on-one support and feedback from seasoned developers, and you have a formula for mass-producing junior devs ready to start their apprenticeships in tech.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Think of it as like getting your driving licence. You&amp;rsquo;re not nearly done learning to drive when you pass your test – you&amp;rsquo;re just beginning. But you have the basic skillset, the confidence, and the clout to be able to strike out on your own and guide your own development from then on.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="3">3.&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Of course, feeling &amp;lsquo;stupid&amp;rsquo; isn&amp;rsquo;t quite the right description. It&amp;rsquo;s more like the feeling you get when you start something as a complete beginner. You lose the heaviness and comfort of the thing you know you&amp;rsquo;re good at, only to have it replaced with the lightness of starting something new, of not knowing what to expect, of the standard that will be expected of you by your teachers and your peers. The cohort is more diverse than I expected for a tech bootcamp. Ages range from 19 to 40, averaging 27 at a guess. A quarter of the group are women – far higher than the tech average. Backgrounds include business consulting, project management, PR of various sorts, marketing, sales, academia, design, with a handful coming straight from university or high school. A few are looking to start businesses straight after graduating, but most, like me, have quit unfulfilling jobs to pursue a better life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the students comments to me that it seems almost unfair that you could be paid money to do something this fun. I&amp;rsquo;m inclined to agree.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="4">4.&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Enrique once told me that learning to code is like learning to cook if you&amp;rsquo;ve never eaten food before. It&amp;rsquo;s totally abstract, and without any frame of reference that tells you when you&amp;rsquo;re on the right lines, when you&amp;rsquo;ve made something that works. So don&amp;rsquo;t be too hard on yourself if you&amp;rsquo;re struggling. Sometimes we all need to hear that. &lt;a href="http://www.roidriscoll.co.uk/">Roi&lt;/a>, now a coach at Makers, tells me that when he took the course, he felt stupid every day for twelve weeks. Constantly feeling dumb is hard, and it&amp;rsquo;s easy to let pride stop you from reaching out for help.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>K spoke to Enrique, Head of Education, about the course. He&amp;rsquo;s worried he&amp;rsquo;s falling behind, and wanted to know if there were any ways to learn more efficiently. &amp;ldquo;Forget &amp;lsquo;working smarter&amp;rsquo;,&amp;rdquo; Enrique told him. &amp;ldquo;Just work &lt;em>harder&lt;/em>. Put the hours in.&amp;rdquo; I think it&amp;rsquo;s advice many of us need to hear – that there&amp;rsquo;s no secret to getting good at this stuff, and nothing magical separating the top of the class from the bottom. You sit down at your computer and &lt;a href="http://www.kungfugrippe.com/post/169873399/clackity-noise">make the clackity noise&lt;/a> until you get good. Skill acquisition is more democratic than you think. Sometimes I want to remind people of that.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="5">5.&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Just as a cook needs to know about the chemistry of baking to turn ingredients into a meal, a coder needs to know how to turn problems into something a computer can understand. Jordan, the endlessly charismatic Director of Marketing, introduced this by comparing object-oriented programming to Platonic forms. Classes are a mould, in whose image objects can be created. These objects inherit properties from their parent class – this tells them &lt;em>who they are&lt;/em>, &lt;em>what they know&lt;/em> and &lt;em>what they can do&lt;/em> – but these objects can themselves be extended and built upon. Understanding this, and how objects relate to each other in a program, was one of the biggest headfucks our cohort came across. But bending your problem like this, organising it into interdependent classes which do things to each other, is the first step in building sotware.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="6">6.&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>At school and university, I always thought Chemistry was one of the more testing subjects. It involved real understanding – wrapping your brain around totally foreign ideas. There was a distinct sense of seeing &amp;lsquo;in your peripheral vision&amp;rsquo;, in a sense; not quite visible head-on, but understandable on some primal level. The moment when those concepts shift into focus is like feeling your brain rewiring itself. I haven&amp;rsquo;t had one of those moments for a long time. Much of my degree was memorisation, and the world of work that followed proved to be mostly intellectually uninspiring, a couple of interesting stints excepted. But working on a code problem and, after hours of rumination, having the answer seemingly present itself to you is truly sublime. And as a beginner, there are few better languages in which to see this happen than Ruby. Powerful, elegant, and expressive – I can see why people fall in love with it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="7">7.&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Makers Academy staggers each intake of students by six weeks, which means every cohort gets a chance to interact with range of would-be software devs at different skill levels. Today is graduation day for the cohort above us. They present their final projects, and &lt;a href="http://ecomba.pro">Enrique&lt;/a> gave a short speech:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;At the end of the day, this is a bunch of people who come here and learn to code in twelve weeks. Which, in itself, is insane. When I first came here, I thought, &amp;lsquo;there&amp;rsquo;s no way you can learn to code in ten weeks.&amp;rsquo; (it was ten weeks back then.) &amp;hellip; But I saw people slowly learning to make machines do their bidding. And I think I speak for the whole team when I say &lt;strong>that&amp;rsquo;s what keeps us alive&lt;/strong> – seeing you all do this incredible thing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://henrystanley.com/images/img_6257.jpg" alt="IMG_6257.JPG">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="8">8.&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Programming is a really weird industry, and one that doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to have any near neighbours. It&amp;rsquo;s very democratic – there are no formal qualifications needed. There are plenty of excellent devs who&amp;rsquo;ve gone on to do great things with software but who never went to university. Courses like the one I&amp;rsquo;m taking are testament to this: provided you have some code under your belt and can show off your technical chops to employers, you&amp;rsquo;re hireable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s also very undemocratic for the same reasons. There&amp;rsquo;s no clear path to becoming a developer. Courses like Makers rely on connections with alumni and local companies to get placements – connections that someone trying to teach themselves to code, the average career changer, couldn&amp;rsquo;t possibly expect to have. Without a structured route into the industry, plenty of good people are locked out of it. Makers is doing well to capitalise on this, connecting wannabe devs with talent-starved companies. But for a growth industry with huge and rising demand for coders, it&amp;rsquo;s surprising there isn&amp;rsquo;t yet a more established way in, given that there are far fewer Computer Science graduates than there are junior dev positions to fill. &lt;a href="http://www.8thlight.com/team/jim-suchy">Jim Suchy&lt;/a>, a developer at 8th Light, talked about this in a talk he gave at &lt;a href="http://pivotallabs.com/">Pivotal Labs&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the big problems software has is that few people stay in it for thirty years: they either get bored and move on to something else, or get moved to a middle management role and never use their coding skills again. The solution, in part, is emphasising craftsmanship – ensuring your skills improve year after year, mentoring others and learning from mentors, keeping you on the path to mastery.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="9">9.&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This course takes &lt;em>grit&lt;/em>. Persistence and confidence under uncertainty are vital qualities, particularly as Makers likes to change the curriciulum regularly. You need to be self-directed, and have done the required pre-course material (and more). This is probably a good thing: as a real developer, you&amp;rsquo;ll frequently encounter things you don&amp;rsquo;t know or understand and will have to teach yourself, or ask someone for help. At the same time, there&amp;rsquo;s a limit to how self-directed you can be.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ultimately, the course is geared towards quickly producing a certain kind of developer, and that&amp;rsquo;s a good thing. It&amp;rsquo;s run from custom online material that includes walkthroughs, mini-tutorials and screencasts. Some weeks are better than others in how thorough they are; there were lots of complaints in weeks five and six where the written material seemed half-finished (Makers has since said it will rewrite those sections of the course). All this goes to show that Makers is as much a social hack as anything else – being on a team with twenty other people all hungry to learn is incredibly motivating just by itself. It&amp;rsquo;s been a fantastic experience so far.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="10">10.&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s over.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>These students have what it takes to be developers. It&amp;rsquo;s not about knowing a language, it&amp;rsquo;s about knowing how to solve a problem; how to bring simplicity into the world.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h2 id="11">11.&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Makers has been a lot of fun. Twelve weeks of intensive work, learning a new skill, totally retraining, having only moments earlier thrown away a half-decent career. Other people have come from similar backgrounds to do the course: one worked in strategic consulting, and had a similar gradual realisation to me that his field was slowly sucking the life out of him.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think everyone, with a single exception, got a lot out of the course. Not everyone is at the same place – those who had done more preparation when they started are further ahead than those who did less. But I think in terms of what&amp;rsquo;s been achieved and learnt in twelve weeks, everyone is amazed at their own progress.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(I should note that Makers recently updated their website to describe the course as being sixteen weeks: twelve weeks taught plus four weeks of full-time self-study beforehand. I suspect this is partly to get much of the boring material out of the way before students join, and partly to ensure everyone&amp;rsquo;s at the same level when they start.)&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="12">12.&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Our final project was an internet-connected thermal printer that could read an RFID card (like an Oyster card), identify you from a database and print out a custom chit – with, say, your calendar events for the day, your current GitHub stats, or (if it&amp;rsquo;s getting late) any Tube delays and the weather for the next hour. The plan is that the device stays at Makers and using becomes part of the daily routine there. It&amp;rsquo;s based on &lt;a href="http://spark.io">Spark Core&lt;/a>, so we call it &lt;a href="http://github.com/henryaj/Maker-Spark-Server">Spark Printer&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s pretty neat. Engineering it was the biggest challenge I&amp;rsquo;ve faced so far. Specifically, working my way through the Spark documentation and figuring out how we were going to make this work – what functionality the Texas Instruments chip on the Core has, how it talks to their cloud server, the limits in size and number of API requests, using &lt;code>Spark.publish&lt;/code> to listen to events from the Spark – all the technical stuff that makes the internet hard and is usually abstracted away for you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most final projects are pretty bog-standard Rails web applications. It was incredibly rewarding to go against the grain and build something different. We made a real product that lives in the physical world, and learnt a bunch of new technologies in the process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While we were building this, the excellent &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chriswaclawek">Chris Waclawek&lt;/a> from Estimote came in to talk about iBeacons and the Estimote product line. The audience was wowed – the more he spoke, the more use cases people dreamed up for these magical little devices that give your phone context and tell it what&amp;rsquo;s nearby. It was the kind of magic that the early iPhone had: none of the components were particularly innovative, but they were put together in such a way that opened up millions of possibilities that Apple had never thought of and that developers were free to implement.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="13">13.&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Whether working in tech will be the dream we hoped for has yet to be seen, but the signs are there. It has a vibrant community, it&amp;rsquo;s full of smart and engaged people, there&amp;rsquo;s a tremendous focus on continuous learning and understanding new technologies. It&amp;rsquo;s a huge world – some people work for giant corporates, some for small web shops, some for themselves, others remotely in far-flung countries. It&amp;rsquo;s meritocratic in a way that I don&amp;rsquo;t think exists elsewhere any more. Now, we polish our &lt;a href="http://github.com/henryaj/cv">GitHub profiles&lt;/a>, ensure our code repos are well-documented, and wait to be placed. I&amp;rsquo;m excited to get started.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Getting started with Sinatra and test-driven development</title><link>https://henrystanley.com/getting-started-with-sinatra-and-test-driven-development/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2014 10:08:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://henrystanley.com/getting-started-with-sinatra-and-test-driven-development/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Sinatra&lt;/strong> is a DSL (&lt;em>domain-specific language&lt;/em>, or a language written for a specific purpose) for building web applications. It can be confusing. If you&amp;rsquo;re a beginner programmer fiddling around with Ruby, the single-user terminal apps you&amp;rsquo;ve been writing are suddenly up on the web for everyone to see, and they need to behave differently as a result.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">require &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#39;sinatra&amp;#39;&lt;/span>
get &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#39;/&amp;#39;&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">do&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#39;hello world!&amp;#39;&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">end&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>If you want to run this and get it working, save this into a file (say &lt;code>server.rb&lt;/code>), go to that directory and run &lt;code>ruby server.rb&lt;/code> (you&amp;rsquo;ll need Ruby installed on your machine, naturally). This code, specifically the bit between &lt;code>get&lt;/code> and &lt;code>end&lt;/code> (called the &lt;em>controller&lt;/em>) will intercept an HTTP GET request sent to &amp;lsquo;/&amp;rsquo;, and reply with &amp;lsquo;hello world!&amp;rsquo; in plain text. Simple.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="routes">Routes&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In the above example, &amp;lsquo;/&amp;rsquo; is the &lt;em>route&lt;/em>. You can define a bunch of other routes, too. For example:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">get &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#39;/hi&amp;#39;&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">do&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Hello Makers!&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&amp;#34;&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">end&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Now, accessing the website path &lt;code>/hi&lt;/code> will yield the above message (which in this case will appear big and bold on the page, as we have wrapped it in &lt;code>h1&lt;/code> tags.)&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="testing-with-cucumber">Testing with Cucumber&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://cukes.info">Cucumber&lt;/a> is used for &lt;em>acceptance testing&lt;/em> – it acts as if it were a person using the application to make sure it works. You can use Cucumber with Sinatra by using the &lt;a href="https://github.com/bernd/cucumber-sinatra">cucumber-sinatra gem&lt;/a>. Get started by running:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>$ cucumber-sinatra init --app SampleApp lib/sample_app.rb
$ rackup
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>Run your Cucumber tests from the command line with &lt;code>$ cucumber&lt;/code>. Now, let&amp;rsquo;s describe a feature using Cucumber:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>$ mkdir feature $ touch homepage.feature
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>Feature: The homepage
In order to show off Cucumber I want to present Cucumber
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>This will run, but doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any actual tests (or &lt;em>scenarios&lt;/em>). Let&amp;rsquo;s add some in the same file.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>Scenario: Being greeted
Given I am a site visitor
When I am on the homepage
Then I should see &amp;quot;Hello hello!&amp;quot;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>This &lt;code>Given&lt;/code>/&lt;code>When&lt;/code>/&lt;code>Then&lt;/code> notation is particular to Cucumber (or specifically Gherkin, the language Cucumber is written in). For each step, you write a step definition in Ruby. cucumber-sinatra has some built in step definitions, so you can write some steps without needing to define them (like &lt;code>When I am on the homepage&lt;/code>). These built-in definitions live in &lt;code>features/step_definitions/&lt;/code>, and there are support files in &lt;code>support/&lt;/code> which do things like substituting &amp;lsquo;homepage&amp;rsquo; for &amp;lsquo;/&amp;rsquo;. Cucumber also uses a language called &lt;a href="https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara">Capybara&lt;/a>, which can interact with a webpage &amp;ndash; filling in forms, clicking links, looking for specific page content, and so on. &lt;strong>Consider deleting &lt;code>features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb&lt;/code> to get some practice in writing your own step definitions&lt;/strong>, which also makes the whole thing seem less like magic and gives you a better understanding of how Cucumber matches up your tests with Capybara methods behind the scenes.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="running-the-damn-thing">Running the damn thing&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Get your server up and running by typing&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>$ rackup
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>What this command &lt;em>actually does&lt;/em> is read through your &lt;code>sample_app.rb&lt;/code> file, looks at the various routes you&amp;rsquo;ve set, and creates a &lt;em>routing table&lt;/em> from it. Then it starts an HTTP server on a particular port and makes it available for connections.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="config">Config&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Look at the following code from the &lt;a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/configuration.html">Sinatra documentation&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">set &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">:views&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">Proc&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">.&lt;/span>new { &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">File&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">.&lt;/span>join(root, &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;templates&amp;#34;&lt;/span>) }
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Why do it this way? Seems kinda convoluted. The reason this is so important is that it bases the path to your &lt;code>views&lt;/code> directory on the site root. If you ran &lt;code>rackup&lt;/code> from a different directory and you&amp;rsquo;d hard-coded the views path, then it would break – it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to find views relative to where you&amp;rsquo;re running the server file from. Using &lt;code>root&lt;/code> gives a salient point that your site is always run from.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="sessions">Sessions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>HTTP by nature is &lt;em>stateless&lt;/em> &amp;ndash; so it doesn&amp;rsquo;t recognise repeat visitors, or even visitors across pages. A lot of basic things fail because of this – how could you log in to a site, for example, if it didn&amp;rsquo;t remember you? This is where sessions come into play. The server creates a unique ID (or UID) for each visitor and stores it in a hash table. This value is served back up to users to identify them, either in a cookie or (more rarely) in the URI itself. A &lt;em>cookie&lt;/em> is returned as part of the header – it&amp;rsquo;s just a string inside the header. A cookie sent by a particular site can only be read from the browser by that site. So how do you use sessions in Sinatra? &lt;code>sample_app.rb&lt;/code>:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">class&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">SampleApp&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;lt;&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">Sinatra&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">::&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">Base&lt;/span>
enable &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">:sessions&lt;/span>
get &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#39;/&amp;#39;&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">do&lt;/span>
@number &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> session
erb &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">:index&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">end&lt;/span>
get &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#39;/a/:number&amp;#39;&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">do&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">|&lt;/span>number&lt;span style="color:#f92672">|&lt;/span>
session&lt;span style="color:#f92672">[&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#39;number&amp;#39;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">]&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> number
redirect to &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#39;/&amp;#39;&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">end&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">end&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Bear in mind that sessions have a hard limit of 4KB!

&lt;p>Hey guys,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m currently a student at Makers Academy – we&amp;rsquo;re on the floor below you in Epworth House. One of the students here has a Little Printer; every morning I see a little chit pinned to the reception desk with today&amp;rsquo;s top stories from Hacker News and the latest trending GitHub repo&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was gutted to hear that you&amp;rsquo;re shutting your doors. How&amp;rsquo;s finding a home for Little Printer and its infrastructure going? I&amp;rsquo;ve no doubt if you open-sourced it there would be a hugely active community of hackers to support and build on your great work – us Makers would happily count ourselves among them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All the best,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Henry&lt;/p>

&lt;p>CoffeeScript is well-documented, succinct language that compiles into JavaScript. If you&amp;rsquo;re bored of JavaScript&amp;rsquo;s abstruse syntax, it&amp;rsquo;s a much more Ruby-like way to approach JavaScript programming – provided you&amp;rsquo;re comfortable with its &lt;a href="https://donatstudios.com/CoffeeScript-Madness">caveats&lt;/a>. This assumes you have &lt;a href="http://nodejs.org/download/">node.js installed&lt;/a> and have installed Mocha, CoffeeScript and Chai with the following commands from the folder you&amp;rsquo;re working in:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>npm install coffee-script
npm install chai
npm install mocha
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>You can also use the &lt;code>-g&lt;/code> flag when running the above commands to install these packages globally, rather than locally. If you&amp;rsquo;re using Mocha for tests, you need to &amp;lsquo;register&amp;rsquo; a CoffeeScript compiler with Mocha first.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>mocha --compilers coffee:coffee-script/register
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>You might also have to create a Mocha options file – /test/mocha.opts – and add the following line: &lt;code>\--compilers coffee:coffee-script/register&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Set up your folder structure like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code> ├── src
│ └── fizzbuzz.coffee
└── test
├── fizzbuzz_spec.coffee
└── mocha.opts
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>Now, let&amp;rsquo;s write a test. &lt;code>test/fizzbuzz_test.coffee&lt;/code>:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-coffeescript" data-lang="coffeescript">chai = &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">require&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#39;chai&amp;#39;&lt;/span>

&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">it&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#39;3 is divisible by 3&amp;#39;&lt;/span>, &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">-&amp;gt;&lt;/span>

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>(Note the capital &amp;lsquo;F&amp;rsquo; in Fizzbuzz, because we&amp;rsquo;re declaring a class.) Be careful of that third line above, though – if you have a fizzbuzz.js file it will use that instead of your fizzbuzz.coffee file! And now, the code: &lt;code>src/fizzbuzz.coffee&lt;/code>:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-coffeescript" data-lang="coffeescript">&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">class&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">Fizzbuzz&lt;/span>
isDivisibleByThree: &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">(number) -&amp;gt;&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">number&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">%&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">3&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">==&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">0&lt;/span>
module.exports = &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">Fizzbuzz&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>And so on&amp;hellip; you know how FizzBuzz goes. Here are our tests after a little bit of refactoring – note the &lt;code>before&lt;/code> method:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-coffeescript" data-lang="coffeescript">chai = &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">require&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#39;chai&amp;#39;&lt;/span>

&lt;p>I recently forgot my email password. My security question (set many years ago) was &amp;ldquo;What do you want to be when you grow up?&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;m unable to recollect my original answer&amp;hellip; I wonder how many others lost their way, and whether they ever find their way back to their dream. 1&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>A friend recently asked for help with a job application. One of the questions asked: &lt;em>what is your greatest achievement?&lt;/em> It was a struggle to think of much. Anything would do: good art, or a big project, or teaching myself something substantial. But I didn&amp;rsquo;t have anything. For her, I limply suggested she talk about her success as a &amp;lsquo;third culture kid&amp;rsquo;&amp;mdash;integrating herself not only into her parents' cultures but as a transplant in a new culture (she was schooled partly in England and partly in Belgium). But this hardly feels like a triumph. &lt;a href="http://casnocha.com/2010/05/the-age-of-early-selfconception.html">Generation Y was the first to have to write their own biographies&lt;/a>. Paul Graham flipped the five most common regrets of the dying and &lt;a href="http://paulgraham.com/todo.html">turned them into daily commands&lt;/a>. Maybe asking probing questions of yourself is a useful tool to help find out what you want, or at least to show you that you &lt;a href="http://henrystanley.com/2013/06/20/i-know-i-dont-know-what-i-want/">don&amp;rsquo;t yet know what you want&lt;/a>.

&lt;p>From _Let&amp;rsquo;s make some Metra noise_1 in the &lt;a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-06-03/opinion/ct-perspec-0605-metra-20110603_1_commuters-quiet-cars-metra-reports">Chicago Tribune&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Commuters asked to interact with other passengers reported having the most pleasant commute. Commuters asked to enjoy their solitude reported the least pleasant commute. The pleasure of conversation was not just restricted to friendly people; we found the same results among introverts and extroverts. If connecting with others is more pleasant than sitting alone, why the strong preference for quiet cars, silent cabs and empty rows on airplanes? &lt;strong>People have strong beliefs about what will make them happy. Sometimes those beliefs are systematically wrong.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This has a surface similarity with &lt;a href="http://casnocha.com/2013/08/would-you-rather-enjoy-today-or-have-great-memories-tomorrow-and-forever.html">Ben Casnocha&amp;rsquo;s idea&lt;/a> that &lt;em>comfortable&lt;/em> and &lt;em>interesting&lt;/em> are mutually exclusive. You can ignore that stranger and be comfortable, or you can make a leap into the unknown, talk to them, and have a more satisfying experience (and memory of it).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Around 5 pm PST on June 2, 2014, our long-time friend and role model Sasha Shulgin gently died after several years of battling various illnesses. He had recently been diagnosed with terminal liver cancer. Around 6:30 pm we received phone calls from two members of the Shulgin team letting us know the sad news. Much love to his family and those whose lives he touched, from the Erowid Crew. He died surrounded by friends and family. Gate gate Para gate Para sam gate Bodhi Svaha! &lt;em>Gone gone,&lt;/em> &lt;em>Gone beyond&lt;/em> &lt;em>Gone way beyond&lt;/em> &lt;em>Hail the goer!&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Shulgin was a notable and prolific chemist, and in his decades-long career managed to rediscover and popularise MDMA (both its recreational use and in PTSD therapy) and develop hundreds of new psychedelic drugs, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2C-B">2C-B&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2C-E">2C-E&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2,5-Dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine">DOM&lt;/a> being the most famous and popular of his creations. Some of his most profound writing can be found in PiHKAL, his memoir-cum-lab notebook that details many of his syntheses and &amp;lsquo;bioassays&amp;rsquo;. &lt;a href="https://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/pihkal/pihkal109.shtml">Entry #109&lt;/a>, on MDMA, is one of the most moving. It &lt;a href="http://henrystanley.com/2011/12/07/be-grateful-for-mdma/">made me realise&lt;/a> that we are already equipped for bliss, and that the substrates of superhappiness are already within us, waiting to be unlocked.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Poverty in the UK is not a fun game or experiment for those who are fortunate enough to never have experienced it to play with. &amp;hellip; If the excuse is that it’s to raise money, find something else to do. Something that doesn&amp;rsquo;t appropriate or make light of other’s &lt;em>[sic]&lt;/em> difficult and painful situations.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The &amp;lsquo;cost per life saved&amp;rsquo; for the most effective charities in the world is hard to calculate. GiveWell estimates it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="http://blog.givewell.org/2012/12/19/cost-effectiveness-of-nets-vs-deworming-vs-cash-transfers/">between $31 and $25,000&lt;/a>. Let&amp;rsquo;s take $25,000 (£15,000) as a very, &lt;em>very&lt;/em> conservative estimate for the cost of saving one life in the developing world (a few dollars spent on a mosquito net or an improved stove could conceivably save a life). That means the £330,000 that Live Below the Line has raised so far, if donated in entirety to highly-effective charities working on extreme poverty, and given the most conservative numbers possible, would &lt;strong>save the lives of at least 22 people in developing countries (likely many more)&lt;/strong>. No matter how distasteful the campaign may be (which I don&amp;rsquo;t think it is), the offence it causes is not morally equivalent to having 22 people needlessly die. Keep donating!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A simple game for a large group of people</title><link>https://henrystanley.com/a-simple-game-for-a-large-group-of-people/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Apr 2014 09:03:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://henrystanley.com/a-simple-game-for-a-large-group-of-people/</guid><description>

&lt;p>Encryption and veganism tend be maligned, niche interests. The crypto nerds who keep their laptops under lock and 2048-bit key and those brave enough to completely eschew animal products are similar groups &amp;ndash; both thoughtful and invested in their beliefs. But neither gets much traction in getting others to adopt their practices, because those practices are costly (socially, in time and expense, etc). As the technology behind vegan food has improved, so has the palatability of the product. Londoners can go to &lt;a href="http://www.vegancross.com/">Vx&lt;/a> for cupcakes that are creamy and delicious &amp;ndash; if they don&amp;rsquo;t mind being bombarded with &amp;ldquo;Vegan Power&amp;rdquo; scarves and animal rights literature. Much more effective would be for vegan shops to sell their cupcakes in other outlets &amp;ndash; and &lt;em>not&lt;/em> branded as vegan. Those who care can look at the ingredients or find the brand online. Casual consumers could pick them up in a supermarket and not know the difference, but have unknowingly eschewed animal products, contributing to the cause. Encrypted chat app &lt;a href="http://crypto.cat">Cryptocat&lt;/a> has little mainstream appeal over Skype or Facebook Chat. Much better would be for a popular platform to use strong cryptography. Those who care would know which mainstream products are the highly-encrypted ones.

&lt;p>Today is &lt;a href="https://thedaywefightback.org/international/">The Day We Fight Back&lt;/a>. Sign the petition, and join the movement against mass surveillance programmes. &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/about/staff/danny-obrien-0">Danny O&amp;rsquo;Brien&lt;/a>, International Director at the EFF, &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7217164">explains in more detail&lt;/a> what the petition &lt;a href="https://necessaryandproportionate.net/">is in support of&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The short answer is that you&amp;rsquo;re signing your support for a set of 13 principles on the application of human rights to communications surveillance ( see &lt;a href="https://necessaryandproportionate.net/">https://necessaryandproportionate.net/&lt;/a> ), that were worked out last year (pre-Snowden, actually) by a coalition of technologists, privacy activists, and legal scholars &amp;hellip; to push the idea in international venues and among key lawmakers in various countries that mass surveillance (as well as a bunch of other practices conducted by the NSA and other spooks, including corruption of crypto standards and backdoors) is a violation of existing human rights standards. This is important internationally because if the NSA gets away with its current behaviour, it&amp;rsquo;ll establish a norm that such surveillance is okay for any government to conduct. We need to push back against that norm. &amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;d encourage anyone who wants to understand better how we&amp;rsquo;re trying to get all governments, not just the US, to craft better surveillance legislation to read the full text of the principles at &lt;a href="https://necessaryandproportionate.net/text">https://necessaryandproportionate.net/text&lt;/a> You can also ask me questions at &lt;a href="mailto:danny@eff.org">danny@eff.org&lt;/a> . It&amp;rsquo;s a long haul project, and we&amp;rsquo;re conducting it alongside legal actions in the US and abroad, shoring up and disseminating crypto tools, and other non-policy defences. But it&amp;rsquo;s pretty amazing to get unanimity with hundreds of privacy groups on some basic principles with which to start building proper, 21st century, surveillance law.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Most arguments sympathetic to mass surveillance programmes make two points:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>that they are &lt;em>reasonable&lt;/em> (that is, have adequate regulatory oversight, only target valid intelligence targets, and are legal), and&lt;/li>
&lt;li>that they are &lt;em>effective&lt;/em>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The first claim is demonstrably untrue. The second is doubtful, and unproven.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>—&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>1.&lt;/strong> Government mass surveillance programmes like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_(surveillance_program)">PRISM&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempora">Tempora&lt;/a> are illegal and out of control. We know that, for example, &lt;a href="http://4bitnews.com/4bitviews/gchq-lied-cabinet/">GCHQ lied to the UK National Security Council&lt;/a> about the extent of their surveillance programme, that &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/23/nsa-barack-obama-phone-data-collection-illegal-privacy-board">a US government privacy board believes NSA bulk collection of phone data is illegal&lt;/a>&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, that the NSA &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/24/nsa-surveillance-world-leaders-calls">monitored calls of 35 world leaders&lt;/a> and that they &lt;a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/secret-nsa-documents-show-how-the-us-spies-on-europe-and-the-un-a-918625-2.html">cracked the encryption used in the UN&amp;rsquo;s internal videoconferencing system&lt;/a> (in clear breach of international law)&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. The last six months have seen numerous other details of the extent of dragnet surveillance programmes become apparent. A &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jan/28/gchq-mass-surveillance-spying-law-lawyer">legal opinion provided today to MPs&lt;/a> suggests that &amp;lsquo;GCHQ&amp;rsquo;s mass surveillance spying programmes are probably illegal and have been signed off by ministers in breach of human rights and surveillance laws.'&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> A recently-released &lt;a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130821/16331524274/declassified-fisa-court-opinion-shows-nsa-lied-repeatedly-to-court-as-well.shtml">FISA court statement&lt;/a> shows that the NSA&amp;rsquo;s programme has long since gone beyond the legal framework that officials say it operates within:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Contrary to the government&amp;rsquo;s repeated assurances, NSA has been repeatedly running queries of the metadata using querying terms that did not meet the standard for querying.&lt;/strong> The Court concluded that this requirement had been &amp;ldquo;so frequently and systemically violated that it can fairly be said that this critical element of the overall… regime has never functioned effectively.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>That article also says the statement &amp;lsquo;details many instances in which the NSA flat out lied to the court&amp;rsquo; and that &amp;lsquo;the agency had &lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;substantially misrepresented&amp;rdquo; the extent of its &amp;ldquo;major collection program&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong> (including the harvesting of &amp;ldquo;internet transactions&amp;rdquo;) for the third time in less than three years.&amp;rsquo; Incredibly, Congress recently had to ask security expert Bruce Schneier to &lt;a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/01/today_i_briefed.html">brief them on NSA activities&lt;/a> becuase &amp;ldquo;the NSA wasn&amp;rsquo;t forthcoming about their activities, and they wanted [him] &amp;ndash; as someone with access to the Snowden documents &amp;ndash; to explain to them what the NSA was doing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think it&amp;rsquo;s pretty unequivocal that both the NSA and GCHQ have lied consistently about the extent of their spying and data collection. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure why we should take their press officers at face value when they say that their programmes are proportional and lawful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>2.&lt;/strong> Effectiveness is a dangerous topic.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Even if, say, torture efficiently got information, if it also galvanized the world against you, provoked many suicide bombers, got your own people tortured, lowered the population&amp;rsquo;s trust and faith in the government, distanced your allies, increased the costs of maintaining the military, and so on, it might not be worth it.&lt;sup id="fnref:4">&lt;a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Nonetheless, the utility of PRISM-style bulk surveillance has yet to be proven. &lt;a href="http://natsec.newamerica.net/nsa/analysis">One analysis&lt;/a> of 225 individuals charged with terror offences in the US since 9/11 showed that:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;hellip; traditional investigative methods, such as the use of informants, tips from local communities, and targeted intelligence operations, provided the initial impetus for investigations in the majority of cases, while the contribution of NSA’s bulk surveillance programs to these cases was minimal.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>A number of mathematicians and statisticians commended in &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887324049504578543542258054884">this Wall Street Journal piece&lt;/a> that avoiding an immensely high false-positive ratio would be a monumental challenge with a dataset so large &amp;ndash; and that there are likely better ways to spend the security services budget. The case for dragnet surveillance is far from clear.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>—&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mass surveillance is illegal and ineffective. People are pushing back. If you want to help, you can &lt;a href="https://supporters.eff.org/donate">donate to the Electronic Frontier Foundation&lt;/a>. Part of me wants to suggest using strong encryption, switching away from the major providers we know to be tapped by the NSA and so on. Do these things by all means, but know that this is merely painting over the problem. The rot goes so deep, with so many layers of the internet compromised (software, hardware, people and organisations), and the security services have such enormous resources at their disposal, that policy overhaul is the only real option for disabling the global panopticon.&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I find it useful during this giddy season to remember that &lt;strong>an emphasis on getting started&lt;/strong>, though currently popular, is not timeless. &amp;hellip; Epictetus doesn’t reject action. But he believes commitment to a pursuit must be preceded by the careful study of what is actually required for success. He uses the Olympic games as an example. &amp;hellip; For most budding ancient athletes, Epictetus implies, [the arduous reality of training] would likely dim the glamor of pursuing the Olympics. But not for everyone. As he then concludes: &amp;ldquo;When you have evaluated all this, if your inclination still holds, then go to war.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Paul Graham says something similar in his essay on &lt;a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/love.html">how to do what you love&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>[I]f you have a day job you don&amp;rsquo;t take seriously because you plan to be a novelist, are you producing? Are you writing pages of fiction, however bad? As long as you&amp;rsquo;re producing, you&amp;rsquo;ll know you&amp;rsquo;re not merely using the hazy vision of the grand novel you plan to write one day as an opiate.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I suspect many people would find both heuristics useful: &lt;em>start cautiously&lt;/em>, being realistic about what&amp;rsquo;s needed for success, and &lt;em>always produce&lt;/em>. Together, they stop you pining for a life that&amp;rsquo;s not what you thought it would be and guide you towards one you&amp;rsquo;ll love.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The temptation of smart drugs</title><link>https://henrystanley.com/the-temptation-of-smart-drugs/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Jan 2014 19:37:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://henrystanley.com/the-temptation-of-smart-drugs/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Mental prowess in pill form is always tempting. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modafinil">Modafinil&lt;/a> offers heightened alertness and wakefulness even during sleep deprivation; &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piracetam">piracetam&lt;/a> promises enhanced cognition and intercerebral blood flow; &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergoloid">ergoloid&lt;/a> offers purported memory and anti-ageing enhancements. There are &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nootropic#Drugs">many more&lt;/a>. I&amp;rsquo;ve promoted these agents to friends and taken some of them myself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The philosophical and ethical case for cognitive enhancement is well established&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>; that they work is (at least for some drugs) beyond doubt&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. But advocates of their use might want to consider the alternatives first. Those taking them rarely consider the &amp;lsquo;optimised base case&amp;rsquo;—a scenario in which everything &lt;em>else&lt;/em> cheaply possible is done before making an intervention. It&amp;rsquo;s another way of asking: what&amp;rsquo;s the control group for this experiment? Testing a drug on people who have a severely deficient diet is all well and good, but your potential consumers might be best advised to make sure their diet is adequate (cheap) instead of taking your drug (expensive).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Compared to taking smart drugs, the optimised base case is distinctly unsexy: &lt;strong>exercising, meditating, getting enough sleep and a good diet that avoids insulin spikes will get you most of the benefits that cognitive enhancers offer&lt;/strong>. These things are cheap, easy, free of side-effects and proven to work (unlike many cognitive enhancers). Edge cases&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> excluded, it&amp;rsquo;s worth doing them first.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Gwern offers readers a warning in &lt;a href="http://www.gwern.net/DNB%20FAQ">his article on dual n-back&lt;/a>, a technique for enhancing working memory and possibly increasing IQ, suggesting they turn back and focus on interventions with bigger marginal returns:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>To those whose time is limited: you may wish to stop reading here. If you seek to improve your life, and want the greatest bang for the buck, you are well-advised to look elsewhere. Meditation, for example, is easier, faster, and ultra-portable. Typing training will directly improve your facility with a computer, a valuable skill for this modern world. Spaced repetition memorization techniques offer unparalleled advantages to students. &amp;hellip; Modest changes to one’s diet and environs can fundamentally improve one’s well-being. Even basic training in reading, with the crudest tachistoscope techniques, can pay large dividends&amp;hellip; And all of these can start paying off immediately.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Work on your optimised base case by making easier, cheaper interventions to your productivity first. Only then is it worth improving it further.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://hailocab.com/london">Hailo&lt;/a> is a London-based tech startup. Its product is a mobile app that lets you find and hail a nearby taxi. It&amp;rsquo;s not the first or last cab-hailing app, but it&amp;rsquo;s best-in-class after a few years and is now also available in a number of other cities around the world. The founders describe themselves as &amp;ldquo;three taxi drivers and three internet entrepreneurs.&amp;rdquo; From a customer&amp;rsquo;s point of view, Hailo fixes a lot of problems that cabs have: sometimes-surly drivers, a pick-up charge, waving one&amp;rsquo;s arm trying to find a cab, having to pay in cash. And it gives benefits to drivers, too: one taxi driver told me that Hailo had revolutionised his business. The company&amp;rsquo;s success hinges on:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The uniqueness of the product.&lt;/strong> Hailo has avoided competing with cheaper minicab firms - which rapidly devolves into cutting fares in a race to the bottom - by putting itself into a different product category: the rides on offer are all licensed black taxis, the kind you&amp;rsquo;d hail from the kerb, which means the drivers have all passed The Knowledge (a formidable test of their navigation acumen, usually involving 3-4 years of training) and are veterans in navigating London&amp;rsquo;s winding streets and treacherous traffic. Black cabs also hold five people, unlike a sedan. And as there are already lots of black cabs roaming the streets looking for passengers, there&amp;rsquo;s usually one nearby.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The quality of the user experience.&lt;/strong> When a customer hails a cab and a driver accepts the job, the app provides the user with its live location, the driver&amp;rsquo;s name, photo and phone number, the cab&amp;rsquo;s numberplate and its ETA.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The quality of the product.&lt;/strong> Rather than stand on the street trying to find a cab, users can hail one while inside. Users are sent a text when the cab is one minute away, and again when it&amp;rsquo;s outside. The taxi will wait outside for five minutes before starting the meter. Customers can pay by credit or debit card, which they can pre-register using the app, tapping in their desired tip when the ride is over. When they walk away from the cab, users are asked to rate their ride out of five.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Appeal to taxi drivers&lt;/strong>, who spend large portions of their day with their cabs empty, looking for work. The driver app runs on an iPhone, which is considerably cheaper than the equipment that radio taxi firms require drivers to rent out. One driver pointed out to me the flexibility of being able to take extra work during quiet times and not when e.g. on holiday - there are no subscription fees, only a per-ride commission. The service also feeds useful data back to drivers, like traffic alerts and job bursts (such as a crowd of theatregoers all requesting cabs after the Sunday matinée: drivers are now alerted and can get there pronto).
The thing that struck me the most while thinking about this was how elegantly Hailo addresses the pains of both taxi users and taxi drivers.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>&lt;em>&lt;a href="http://www.futurefest.org/">FutureFest&lt;/a> was yesterday. Here are some (very rough) notes from the talks I heard.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Rachel Armstrong&lt;/strong>: black sky thinking. Not sure what&amp;rsquo;s going on here. Organic, natural computing and chemistry. Other audience members nearby seemed befuddled.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Tamar Kasriel&lt;/strong>: business planning for future growth in the face of uncertainly. Scenario planning: Kahn broke apart the way the future is thought of by asking what the world would look like after nuclear way. What about personal scenario planning? Applying business futures to one&amp;rsquo;s personal life. Accept uncertainty, be objective/distant, treat it as a process that won&amp;rsquo;t happen by itself. Such planning can be a good defence against regret. Thinking far out can depersonalise planning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Rohan Gunatillake&lt;/strong>: meditation is a mirror to the mind. Lots of tech exists for fostering mindfulness. But how do we develop eg websites, social networks aimed at increasing human happiness/wellbeing? How do we design interfaces to reward patience? How do we make email more connective? What about wearable technology that reminds people of their physicality? Is a &amp;lsquo;technoptimist&amp;rsquo;. The web is 22-33; when Rohan was that age he was interested in sex, money and status. The web is the same. As people grow with time and through crises, so the internet will develop.&lt;/p>

I really need to read Gödel, Escher, Bach. Showed an exhibit of a piano board that plays itself based on the silhouettes of birds on telegraph lines. Showed Twitchr, a map-based &amp;lsquo;open score&amp;rsquo; using recorded birdsong.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Marek Kohn&lt;/strong>: images of cities underwater are unrealistic and risk encouraging fatalism. But climate change is about more than just the weather: it&amp;rsquo;s about social change, both within Britain and between countries. Britain will warm, but less than almost anywhere else in the world. British weather will become the envy of the world, and people will flock. Terraces will be favoured over detached houses. Life will become more communal and social, relying on shared resources. Notably, Britain will gain economically relative to continental Europe because Europe will heat up much more significantly. Perhaps the continent will be a test bed for new forms of communal, convivial living. Britain&amp;rsquo;s fortunes will depend entirely on immigration from other countries. The divisiveness of climate change may cause conflict, both within Britain and between European countries. We need to evolve a more nuanced from of freedom, not in individual consumption but in collaborative political decision-making.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Ian Goldin&lt;/strong>: this is a great and very previous moment in history - during the twenty minute talk, life expectancy of the audience has increased by five minutes - but it risks being an exception rather than a trend. The source of progress, connectivity and immigration, is at risk of being rejected and its benefits lost. The unwieldy institutions of the 1950s are no longer fit for purpose. At the centre, the tension between individual and collective freedoms and tragedy of the commons. Accepting a loss of individual and national sovereignty and freedom will be required. Climate change, antibiotic resistance are all examples of this. Increasing population density will mean pandemics are a serious risk. The financial crisis may have been the first of a number of 21st-century crises. So what does the future hold, and what can we do about it?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Ben Hammersley&lt;/strong>: began the talk by getting us all to stand up, stretch, say hi to our neighbours (such a good idea). IARPA is an intelligence technology agency, and advertises its requests for technology proposals at &lt;a href="iarpa.gov">iarpa.gov&lt;/a>. Its recent METAPHOR programme looked for talented linguists to help interpret metaphors and analogies in tapped materials. Looked at analogies and metaphor in architecture, operating systems, the floppy disk icon meaning save. &amp;ldquo;To those of you in the room with the last remaining BlackBerrys in the world&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; Shifting analogies and metaphors is, in a way, the definition of innovation. Ben shared two works in progress: one on judging counter-terror measures in the same way we judge new drugs, setting off the greater good for the various negatives these measures involve; the other, on countries. Since 1492, only one European country (Portugal) has survived in an identical shape. What if we redrew the map based on culture, social connection, trade, intellectual cooperation? Think about where you live, and where your allegiances lie - with similar people, not clumps of soil. Examine metaphors and try as work out what&amp;rsquo;s behind that symbolism and whether it&amp;rsquo;s still valid. The compere notes the weird etymology of country names, including Welsh being the German word for &amp;lsquo;foreigner&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Alex Fleetwood&lt;/strong>: &amp;ldquo;Where are the monoliths built to our artists?&amp;rdquo; Imagines a future game space in cities, with salaried employees choosing games for players based on their expertise and experience. Such spaces will be supported by governments, and will focus on archiving old games and hardware. Argues that such cultural institutions have a great impact on what art is made. Games are rarely made for their own sake – usually in service of the prevailing culture&amp;rsquo;s values.&lt;/p>

Manufacturing can happen wherever there are 3D printers. Each toy is unique. The toys have passed safety/CE certification. Boy and girl dolls have knees and elbows (so they can ride motorbikes!). 3D printing has totally changed the way toys can be made and personalised. Similarly, toy shops traditionally get toy companies to bid for shelf space - selling online has changed this. Also allows for agile, iterative development - impossible in mass manufacturing. A/B test and experiment as you go. Makies are now available in Selfridges - a podium let&amp;rsquo;s customers design dolls on tablets. Challenges include getting to a £20 price point, building up the brand, building games around Makies.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Google fights aging</title><link>https://henrystanley.com/google-fights-aging/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Sep 2013 17:00:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://henrystanley.com/google-fights-aging/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Details are thin at this point, but Google co-founder Larry Page &lt;a href="https://plus.google.com/+LarryPage/posts/Lh8SKC6sED1">has announced&lt;/a> Calico, a company that will focus on &amp;ldquo;the challenge of aging and associated diseases.&amp;rdquo; Art Levinson, former Genentech CEO, will be Calico&amp;rsquo;s Chief Executive.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Art and I are excited about tackling aging and illness. These issues affect us all—from the decreased mobility and mental agility that comes with age, to life-threatening diseases that exact a terrible physical and emotional toll on individuals and families. And while this is clearly a longer-term bet, we believe we can make good progress within reasonable timescales with the right goals and the right people.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The front cover of the &lt;a href="http://business.time.com/2013/09/18/google-extend-human-life/">September 30 issue of TIME&lt;/a>, which has an exclusive interview with Page, makes an apt point: that the search giant&amp;rsquo;s plan to extend human lifespan &amp;ldquo;would be crazy – if it weren&amp;rsquo;t Google&amp;rdquo;. For years, the anti-aging movement and its big players, notably Aubrey de Grey&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="http://sens.org">SENS&lt;/a>, have been members of the transhumanist vanguard and little else&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, not noticed or supported by mainstream scientists. Part of that is down to stubbornness, poor marketing and bad PR, and part down to status quo bias on the part of everyone else. I&amp;rsquo;ve wondered what the anti-aging movement will do to be taken seriously. This is how it happens. Getting someone as influential and moneyed as Google on board is the credibility and funding boost longevity science needs. &lt;em>Fight Aging!&lt;/em> has a &lt;a href="https://www.fightaging.org/archives/2013/09/exciting-times-google-to-back-longevity-science.php">good analysis&lt;/a> of the ways this one could go (ranging from Calico backing very conservative anti-aging efforts to it directly funding rejuvenative medicine) but offers a caution:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>This effort by Google has just started, and we have no idea how it [will] turn out. Google doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a good track record for going above and beyond the safe, staid norm when it comes to philanthropy. Their initiatives in that respect have generally been very mainstream, very similar to what other factions of Big Philanthropy are up to, and very unlikely to change the world. &amp;hellip; That said, I will also be surprised if significant money fails to flow from Google to SENS by 2018 or so[.]&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>History is littered with the carcasses of wealthy men who suddenly became aware of their mortality and tried to fight it. But the study of the biology of aging has matured hugely in the last two decades. Maybe this marks a turning point in biogerontology&amp;rsquo;s story.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Merely deciding you’re committed for the long-term vs the short-term makes an enormous difference. [In the study] progress was determined not by any measurable aptitude or trait, but by a tiny, powerful idea the child had before even starting lessons. The differences were staggering. With the same amount of practice, the long-term-commitment group outperformed the short-term-commitment group by 400 percent. The long-term-commitment group, with a mere twenty minutes of weekly practice, progressed faster than the short-termers who practiced for an hour and a half. When long-term commitment combined with high levels of practice, skills skyrocketed.&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Crime in England and Wales is 53% lower now than it was in 1995&lt;/li>
&lt;li>0.6% of girls under 16 become pregnant every year (the public believes it&amp;rsquo;s more like 15%)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>£74.2bn is spent on pensions annually&lt;/li>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="#3" title="2013-07-10 11:54:00">Jason Retter&lt;/a>:&lt;/strong> 0.6% of all girls under 16? That seems incredibly high given that only a small percentage of all girls under 16 would actually be able to conceive. So if you looked at a subcategory of girls that are both under 16 and able to conceive and then looked at the percentage of this group that becomes pregnant each year, surely this figure would be closer to the 15% figure than to 0.6%? And in that case the public is probably right to be shocked&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m trying to be more open to the idea that I don&amp;rsquo;t know what I want. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to get swept up and inherit other people&amp;rsquo;s values wholesale; pause for a moment to reflect on what you really want, or how to find that out.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>To be mature you have to realize what you value most. It is extraordinary to discover that comparatively few people reach this level of maturity. They seem never to have paused to consider what has value for them. They spend great effort and sometimes make great sacrifices for values that, fundamentally, meet no real needs of their own. Perhaps they have imbibed the values of their particular profession or job, of their community or their neighbors, of their parents or family. Not to arrive at a clear understanding of one’s own values is a tragic waste. You have missed the whole point of what life is for. &lt;em>—Eleanor Roosevelt&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

Make New Mistakes. Make glorious, amazing mistakes. Make mistakes nobody&amp;rsquo;s ever made before. Don&amp;rsquo;t freeze, don&amp;rsquo;t stop, don&amp;rsquo;t worry that it isn&amp;rsquo;t good enough, or it isn&amp;rsquo;t perfect, whatever it is: art, or love, or work or family or life.

&lt;p>&lt;em>Is some research too dangerous to be published? Lab-made strains of bird flu have raised questions about state involvement in mitigating the threat from “dual use” research. Henry Stanley explains&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In November 2011, a Dutch group succeeded in making a highly pathogenic variant of avian flu (H5N1) which, if released, could cause a global pandemic. Ever since, a storm has raged as scientists and governments worldwide attempt to deal with the findings and how they should be safely disseminated—if at all.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>H5N1, the avian flu strain which caused so much concern in the past decade, is poorly transmitted between birds and humans, and its spread has been limited mostly to those who worked with infected poultry. While only a few hundred cases were confirmed, the WHO estimates that sixty per cent of those infected died from the disease. By comparison, the seasonal H1N1 virus is easily spread but rarely fatal, killing only the very young, the elderly and the infirm. This difference in transmissibility is crucial and sets the two strains of the virus apart.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dr Ron Fouchier’s team, based at the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, have found that five mutations in two genes in H5N1 marry bird flu’s lethality with seasonal flu’s airborne transmissibility between mammals, creating a strain which its creator describes as “probably one of the most dangerous … you can make”&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. The 1918 flu pandemic that killed between 50 and 100 million had a comparatively low mortality rate&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, with no more than one in five infected dying&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. That the new superstrain is only five point mutations away from wild H5N1 shows that the virus could easily acquire genetic changes which would make it a highly contagious killer. More concerning still, the mutations observed are all present in nature, but have so far only occurred separately in various wild strains of the virus. Genetic recombination—as occurs when an individual is infected with multiple strains of the virus—could randomly produce the ultra-lethal variant.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another researcher, Yoshihiro Kawaoka, made a somewhat different discovery. He combined the H5 gene—a variant of hemagglutinin, the protein which allows flu virus to recognize and fuse with vertebrate cells&lt;sup id="fnref:4">&lt;a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>—with the rest of the genome from a seasonal H1N1 virus from 2009, and found that, while the new virus spread rapidly between ferrets (the model organism of choice for studying flu), it was no more lethal than seasonal flu. Importantly, current antivirals and flu vaccines were effective against it&lt;sup id="fnref:5">&lt;a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. Before publication, &lt;em>Science&lt;/em> sent Kawaoka’s draft manuscript to the US National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity (NSABB) for counsel, as is standard practice when carrying out “dual use” research, or work which has the potential to threaten public health. The NSABB, an organization known to generally exercise a light touch when it comes to such research&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, advised that the paper be altered, with experimental and genetic details redacted and released to scientists on a ‘need to know’ basis&lt;sup id="fnref:6">&lt;a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The team’s work has sparked fears that the virus could be weaponized by being reassembled from the published data, amidst other concerns. The facility in which work on the virus was done is at biosafety level 3+ (BSL-3+). Critics argue this doesn’t reflect the true threat accidental release poses, arguing that maximum-security BSL-4, which demands all lab workers wear positive pressure suits and be subjected to multiple decontamination steps, be the required standard for working with such a dangerous pathogen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fouchier is unimpressed with the furore. He doesn’t think that an as-yet theoretical bioterrorist attack merits censorship of vital science. “Bioterrorists can’t make this virus; it’s too complex, you need a lot of expertise.” Besides which, the NSABB doesn’t properly weight the public health benefits gained from a better understanding of potential future flu strains, he says. He draws comparisons with the 1975 Asilomar Conference, in which scientists agreed to a voluntary code of conduct regarding then-emerging recombinant DNA research, except that those restrictions were agreed by the scientific community as a whole, whereas the moratorium on publishing work on mutant H5N1 is a top-down imposition&lt;sup id="fnref:7">&lt;a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. He hopes that by developing and studying these very virulent strains we can better understand how the flu virus develops the ability to spread as an aerosol, and insists that no half-measures will do&lt;sup id="fnref:8">&lt;a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. Moreover, the NSABB’s recommendations expose the vagaries of censoring science: who exactly ‘needs to know’? Other, less-secure labs working on H5N1 may unwittingly produce an ultra-virulent strain; these labs presumably ought to have access to Fouchier and Kawaoka’s sequence data&lt;sup id="fnref:6">&lt;a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nonetheless, Fouchier, Kawaoka and thirty-seven coauthors signed an open letter declaring a sixty-day hiatus in research on highly pathogenic H5N1 strains to provide time for the debate on the appropriateness of their work to be carried out&lt;sup id="fnref:9">&lt;a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. Fouchier insists the moratorium is a response to the threat of the NSABB taking matters into its own hands to regulate biological research directly, and only a temporary measure as he waits for the US government to decide how best to proceed. “My preference,” he states in a recent radio interview&lt;sup id="fnref:8">&lt;a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, “is to publish in full.” Kawaoka agrees, claiming that enough information already exists publicly to allow the production of an H5-bearing pandemic virus, and that any attempts to redact papers would be unwieldy and unworkable&lt;sup id="fnref:5">&lt;a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While the number of fatalities may be small, John Oxford, Professor of Virology at Queen Mary University of London, points out that the equivalent of two million life-years were lost in the recent bird flu outbreak, mostly from young people. That more people were not killed, he says, was a direct result of the measures taken to stop the spread of the virus and of research into its mechanism&lt;sup id="fnref:8">&lt;a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. This view, that it would be short-sighted to censor research on H5N1, is shared by many in the scientific community. Others are more guarded: Kwok-Yung Yuen, Chair of Infectious Disease at the University of Hong Kong, is well aware of the insights the work provides and the potential benefit to public health. But at the same time he believes that partly-censoring the research would at least buy time to develop and stockpile vaccines against H5N1 to pre-empt an epidemic (be it natural or man-made)&lt;sup id="fnref:10">&lt;a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The January 19 issue of &lt;em>Nature&lt;/em> gave a cross-section of views from biosecurity, infectious disease and global health experts. Their opinions were divided, with some calling for part-redaction, some expressing concern at lab infections and others at the threat of accidental release of virus from a secure facility&lt;sup id="fnref:10">&lt;a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.

In the meantime, it is hoped a consensus will emerge in the two months before the hiatus ends.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Sasha Shulgin is a legendary chemist and psychonaut and inventor of hundreds of psychedelics. In 1991, he and his wife, Ann, published a book. Part-novel and part-cookbook, &lt;em>PiHKAL&lt;/em>—Phenethylamines I Have Known And Loved—told his story and the stories of the compounds he and his friends had ingested, a process he ironically termed ‘LAB’, or Large Animal Bioassay.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s a gorgeous book, and a work that is still unmatched in its candour and novelty (and notoriety).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Flip to the back, and there are 179 entries on various &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substituted_phenethylamine">substituted phenethylamines&lt;/a>, each with intricate synthesis notes and experience reports detailing the effects each compound had on him and his close friends.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My favourite is &lt;a href="http://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/pihkal/pihkal109.shtml">#109&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>MDMA (MDM; ADAM; ECSTASY; 3,4-METHYLENEDIOXY-N-METHYLAMPHETAMINE)&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As the material came on I felt that I was being enveloped, and my attention had to be directed to it. I became quite fearful, and my face felt cold and ashen. I felt that I wanted to go back, but I knew there was no turning back. Then the fear started to leave me, and I could try taking little baby steps, like taking first steps after being reborn. The woodpile is so beautiful, about all the joy and beauty that I can stand. I am afraid to turn around and face the mountains, for fear they will overpower me. But I did look, and I am astounded. …&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I feel absolutely clean inside, and there is nothing but pure euphoria. I have never felt so great, or believed this to be possible. The cleanliness, clarity, and marvelous feeling of solid inner strength continued throughout the rest of the day, and evening, and through the next day. I am overcome by the profundity of the experience … All the next day I felt like ‘a citizen of the universe’ rather than a citizen of the planet…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Everyone must get to experience a profound state like this. I feel totally peaceful. I have lived all my life to get here, and I feel I have come home.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am complete.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Shulgin saw that MDMA had huge potential. A gentle empathogen and entactogen (meaning literally “to touch within”), it allows deep but unthreatening introspection. He was certain it would be of use in therapy, and only now are its medicinal properties being scientifically evaluated. He also knew that if it became a street drug, its use in psychotherapy would be drastically limited. He was right.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The MDMA experience tells us something important about being human. It shows that states of transcendence and emotional bliss beyond our normal capacity are possible. It proves that our brains are capable of amazing things, and that the substrates of superhappiness exist within our current wetware, even if such states are not normally available to us.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Shulgin was struck when he realised that the psychedelic experiences he had were not contained within the few hundred milligrams of white powder at the bottom of the glass, but were contained within him. The drug was merely a catalyst for revealing what was already there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We should be grateful that we are already so rich, and that there is so much inside for us to discover.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Don't confuse consuming and producing</title><link>https://henrystanley.com/dont-confuse-consuming-and-producing/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Nov 2011 22:31:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://henrystanley.com/dont-confuse-consuming-and-producing/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;em>I’m trying to figure out what to do with my life. Give me your thoughts.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Michael Idov writes in his piece &lt;em>&lt;a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/life/a_fine_whine/2005/12/bitter_brew.html">Bitter Brew&lt;/a>&lt;/em> in Slate:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I never realized how ubiquitous the dream of opening a small coffeehouse was until I fell under its spell myself. It seemed that just about every boho-professional couple had indulged in this fantasy at some point or another.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The dream of running a small cafe has nothing to do with the excitement of entrepreneurship or the joys of being one’s own boss—none of us would ever consider opening a Laundromat or a stationery store… The small cafe connects to the fantasy of throwing a perpetual dinner party… To a couple in the throes of the cafe dream, money is almost an afterthought. Which is good, because they’re going to lose a lot of it.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This article is the story of a young married couple who decide to run a cute little coffee shop (in New York, but any big city’ll do). They’re enamoured with the idea of it, not because they want financial independence, to set their own hours or to be their own boss(es), but because they’ve fallen in love with the notion that providing that service will be just as fun as consuming it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The thing is, running a coffee shop is nothing like drinking lattes in a coffee shop. It’s gruelling, expensive and hugely risky. That’s why so many people fail—because they were in love with an aspect of the job that doesn’t exist.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My love of science, of biology and biogerontology and finding practical ways of slowing ageing can be subjected to a similar analysis. I’ve made the mistake of thinking that reading about/talking about/enjoying the fruits of scientific advance will be just as fun as actually doing the benchwork myself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s the distinction between what you do day-to-day and the narrative you invent to describe your job—a distinction I’ve been deliberately (if unconsciously) blurring by describing my work in a biogerontology lab as making a grand contribution to understanding and ending ageing. It’s a great story but it’s not the truth, and wouldn’t be even if I had some scintillating project analysing rat brain ageing or dietary restriction in flies. I would still be a technician, just like the coffee shop owner is still a vendor and not a coffee connoisseur.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I could just as easily enjoy science from afar, and that way, I might be able to stay a consumer.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What's the point of OpenPCR?</title><link>https://henrystanley.com/whats-the-point-of-openpcr/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Oct 2011 20:59:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://henrystanley.com/whats-the-point-of-openpcr/</guid><description>
&lt;p>For those not in the know, PCR is a standard biological technique that lets you make lots of copies of a piece of template DNA. It’s crucial because a lot of molecular biology relies on having a large amount of a particular DNA, so it makes possible everything from DNA fingerprinting to genomics to forensics to getting bacteria to express a gene of interest. Its invention changed the face of modern biology.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thermocyclers, the machines which do PCR, are expensive. Thousands of dollars expensive. And there’s no good reason for it because they’re pretty simple: they just need to reliably heat up and cool down sample tubes to allow the chemicals inside to do their job. In fact, early PCR machines were just three water baths, each at a specific temperature, between which a technician would move their samples.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://openpcr.org/">OpenPCR&lt;/a> is an open-source PCR machine. From &lt;a href="http://openpcr.org/2010/06/why-we-built-openpcr/">Why we built OpenPCR&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>There are really two core benefits I see to a machine like OpenPCR. The first is a drastically lower price point. … The second … was to create a substrate for further hacking.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I love it. I want one. It’s a really gorgeous machine, too, made of laser-etched wood panels with black rivets. And it’s cheap, with kits costing $599 and taking around three hours to assemble.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But who’s it for?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hobbyists will certainly be attracted by the low price, but molecular biology requires &lt;em>a lot&lt;/em> of kit. Thermocycler aside, you need primers for each reaction you want to carry out which often have to be custom-made, all the enzymes and reagents for the PCR itself, plus restriction enzymes and the equipment to run a gel to visualise the DNA you’ve amplified (so that’s agarose, buffer, DNA dye, an electrophoresis tank and a UV visualiser). Most of which has to be shipped refrigerated by companies which probably won’t sell to individuals.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I want to see home-brew biology flourish. I love the idea that you can analyse your own DNA to see if you have a particular polymorphism, or &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/07/110721095855.htm">identify unlisted plant ingredients in commercial teas&lt;/a>. But molecular biology has always been capital-intensive and as long as that’s the case, the kind of “&lt;a href="http://www.oscon.com/oscon2011/public/schedule/detail/20532">garage biology&lt;/a>” that OpenPCR’s inventors want to encourage will be out of reach for most.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Shortcuts for supercentenarians</title><link>https://henrystanley.com/shortcuts-for-supercentenarians/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Oct 2011 22:09:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://henrystanley.com/shortcuts-for-supercentenarians/</guid><description>
&lt;p>The aging process is complex and multifaceted, but slowing it may be easier than we thought—and in biogerontology, there might be such a thing as a free lunch.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the 1930s, biogerontologist Clive McKay found that rats whose diets were reduced to sixty per cent of what they would eat normally were living healthily, with glossy fur and eyes unclouded by cataracts, at ages where their normally-fed compatriots were dying&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. McKay thought wrongly that it was stunting development that extended lifespan; Ed Masoro would later find that caloric restriction could be started during adulthood and cause a similarly profound drop in mortality&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. Calorie restriction (or CR) has been found to work in mice, rats, worms, fruit flies and yeast, and probably works in higher organisms as well&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. A trial at the University of Wisconsin–Madison is attempting to determine the effects of CR in rhesus macaques, the most humanlike animals yet used in such experiments. While the final results of the trial are many years away—these monkeys do live for 25 years on average, after all—already the animals on CR show signs of increased lifespan and ‘youthspan’, with normally-fed monkeys dying at three times the rate of calorie restricted ones&lt;sup id="fnref:4">&lt;a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Biogerontology’s grand claim—that we can control and slow aging—is thus made credible. If simple interventions can reliably increase lifespan in animals, they almost certainly work in humans, too. The island of Okinawa off the southernmost point of Japan harbours the world’s largest population of supercentenarians (those lucky few who live for a century or longer), and it is likely no coincidence that the Okinawan Japanese have a culture of leaving the stomach part empty at the end of every meal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course, calorie restriction is hardly fun. The regimen has side-effects and few would be able to stomach a one-third reduction in their calorie intake. But as proof-of-principle, CR shows that there are low-hanging fruit in life extension: simple biological switches that can increase longevity. Finding a simple way of flicking those switches is a major goal of modern biogerontology.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a phenomenon, CR is intriguing: if we have genes that specifically lengthen animal lifespan, as xenometabolic enzymes, heat stock proteins and protein chaperones seem to&lt;sup id="fnref:5">&lt;a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, why aren’t those genes switched on all the time? Certainly if living longer was evolutionarily favourable, they would be. But the opportunity cost of expending energy on cellular maintenance is investing less in reproduction. In species where early and prolific reproduction is evolutionarily favored, faster aging is promoted at the expense of extended lifespans and long reproductive careers. The battery of life-extending genes that lie dormant within so many species are only activated in times when food is scarce and conditions harsh, delaying reproduction to concentrate on surviving the drought before returning to full reproductive capacity. Simply, CR probably switches on a form of reproductive diapause—a way of adjusting the balance between reproduction and longevity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sirtuins are a major candidate in the search for ‘CR mimetics’, or drugs that trick the body into thinking calories are few and far between, so simulating CR. Notable among them is resveratrol, a compound found in grape skins and present in red wine, which stirred much enthusiasm in the field (and not a few high-profile headlines). If these chemicals could trick our bodies into thinking their calorie intake was being drastically reduced—if they could switch on longevity genes—we could enjoy longer lifespans and healthspans. With most people having few children late in life, the cost of reduced fertility would not be a hard one to bear.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>David Sinclair was formerly a postdoctoral researcher working for Leonard Guarente in MIT where he discovered that the protein Sir2 prevents the formation of ERCs (extrachromosomal rDNA circles, a key biomarker of aging in yeast). Another postdoc in that lab, Matthew Kaeberlein, found that overexpressing the &lt;em>Sir2&lt;/em> gene extended yeast lifespan. The gold rush for CR mimetics began, with Sinclair founding Sirtris, a company trying to develop and commercialise sirtuin-based anti-aging compounds&lt;sup id="fnref:6">&lt;a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. His firm was later acquired by pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline for a staggering $720million, symbolic of the commercial significance a drug that could slow aging would have.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But the effectiveness and pututative mechanism of resveratrol has been called into question. It extends the lifespan of mice, but only those fed a high-fat diet. Later work by Kaeberlein failed to find any life-extending effect of resveratrol on several strains of yeast&lt;sup id="fnref:7">&lt;a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. The compound was found to increase the lifespan of the humble nematode C. elegans, but its activity may be unique to that species alone (a ‘private’ rather than ‘public’ mechanism of aging). More worryingly, a 2010 study by David Gems and Linda Partridge at UCL’s Institute for Healthy Ageing found that sirtuin overexpression left fly lifespans unchanged and caused only minimal life extension in worms, casting doubt over the entire premise that firms like Sirtris are counting on&lt;sup id="fnref:8">&lt;a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Gems recently made newspaper headlines when his laboratory published a paper claiming poor-quality research was to blame for the conflicting results&lt;sup id="fnref:9">&lt;a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. Specifically, poorly-controlled genetics (such as sirtuin overexpressing animals picking up other life-extending mutations) seem to account for the life-extending properties described by previous researchers, and Gems showed this by demonstrating that sirtuin overexpression and lifespan extension were separable genetically. Guarente challenges this in the same issue of &lt;em>Nature&lt;/em>, claiming that he used the best techniques available at the time, and that carefully-controlled followup work confirms a (somewhat smaller) life-extending effect&lt;sup id="fnref:10">&lt;a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It might be years before sirtuins’ mysteries are properly described. Some think that these compounds don’t activate the sirtuin pathway at all, perhaps acting via TOR (target of rapamycin) signalling. Other sirtuin activators with potencies orders of magnitude greater than resveratrol are under development and may work where resveratrol failed. But even if Sirtris fails to be the jewel in GlaxoSmithKline’s crown and sirtuins act by entirely different pathways, CR mimetics might be a quick and dirty way to extend lifespan without needing to know much at all about the underlying processes of aging.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This month’s &lt;em>Lates&lt;/em> night at the Science Museum—described as an evening of ‘free adults-only entertainment’—put the spotlight on the study of happiness. One event, a talk by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Wilson_(psychologist)">Glenn Wilson&lt;/a>, touched on a number of aspects of happiness research. In its modern form, positive psychology is a relatively young field, and it focuses specifically on evidence-based methods for improving happiness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Positive psychology has a few perhaps obvious things to tell us: being employed (or better, self-employed) and having big, external life goals are all sources of happiness. People with a small group of intimate friends are happier than those with large groups of superficial friends. Commuting is miserable, but being jobless is worse. Negative self-talk is poisonous to happiness, which is why so many treatments for depression focus on quashing it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There were some strange ones, too: the anticipation of a holiday is more enjoyable than the holiday itself, so perhaps several short breaks are advisable to maximise pre-vacation euphoria. Churchgoing rather than theological belief brings happiness to the religious. And women, in spite of increased equality and opportunity, have been becoming more unhappy for years. This is the counterintuitive dark side of the study of happiness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But the talk felt trite. Drugs, for example, were quickly dismissed as reducing happiness long-term. Of course, highly addictive drugs like heroin likely produce net unhappiness. But volunteers given psilocybin, the active ingredient of magic mushrooms, overwhelmingly enjoyed the experience—and the majority said it had a lasting positive effect on their lives when asked 18 months later. Few would debate that, while it can be harmful, alcohol’s societal role could be a net good if it encourages people to make friends and enjoy rich social experiences. Yet an honest, evidence-based appraisal of different drugs’ harms and benefits—one that considers the enjoyment they bring as a benefit—is presumably too unpalatable to ever get funding at a time when every nation on the planet has drug prohibition laws of one sort or another.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What of the role of personality in happiness? In a culture where connections and networking are emphasised as crucial to building a career, do extroverts fare better than introverts? Malcolm Gladwell writes extensively about the role of ‘soft skills’ in people’s success—skills which he believes middle-class parents pass onto their children but working-class parents do not—like assertiveness, social graces and other learned behaviours which aren’t formally taught but can drastically alter life outcomes and signal membership of a particular social group, for better or for worse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wilson also mentioned the ‘hedonic treadmill’, the notion that people return to a particular happiness set-point over time. Positive life events don’t affect long-term happiness—but nor do negative ones. (That paraplegics are no less happy than the able-bodied in spite of their loss is proof of this.) The hedonic treadmill guarantees that the we have much less control over our happiness than we would like, and that, in the end, it might be impossible to move our happiness significantly away from some immutable mean.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Later in the evening came a brief talk in a tiny, packed room from a curator at the Museum seeking to expand their collections. The resident Historian of Psychology reviewed the history of animal models of addiction. It was a useful lesson in experimental bias: the first animal models of addiction used rats placed in a Skinner box (a metal box with an assortment of levers) to see whether they would prefer to self-administer morphine delivered straight into the brain to to press a lever to get a food pellet. The mice preferred the morphine over food and water, even when they were dying of starvation. Ever since, this has been the prevailing model of addictive drugs - that the sheer force of the desire to consume them is overwhelming.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But a protégée of Skinner’s, Bruce K. Alexander, wasn’t convinced. He worried that by moving caged rats around when they were experimented on, the rats were responding more to the attention they were getting than to the drug, and that the results Skinner had seen were just an artefact of this. He set up Rat Park—an open space with toys, other rats and faux greenery—which he thought more accurately emulated rats’ natural environment. In Rat Park, he found that rats actually preferred water to morphine water, perhaps because the morphine made them asocial and unable to play with other rats. Adding naloxone to the drugged water neutralised the effect of the morphine, and the rats were then happy to drink it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The outcome probably wasn’t as stark as was presented in the talk—other researchers succeeded only partially in reproducing the experiment—but the result is striking enough. Alexander’s experiments failed to have the intended effect on his peers, though, and the models of addiction he purported to have rubbished live on in contemporary academia. He now spends his days studying human drug addiction through history and anthropology, and his latest book is based on the premise that addiction is a social phenomenon, not a pharmacological one. He wants to ‘reshape society with enough force and imagination’ that people would be able to find meaning in their lives—meaning that he thinks would take the place of addiction in many cases.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Positive psychology is increasingly seen as a highly respected discipline. Studying mood and developing the tools to improve people’s happiness is a noble and ambitious goal. So is Bruce Alexander’s attempt to reframe addiction as a social disease—and to build a new society whose properties don’t allow it to exist. Both require an unflinching devotion to empiricism. But at their core, they are fields driven by a desire to understand what makes people tick, and an ambition to improve the human condition.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The youth of synthetic biology</title><link>https://henrystanley.com/the-youth-of-synthetic-biology/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Nov 2010 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://henrystanley.com/the-youth-of-synthetic-biology/</guid><description>
&lt;p>In May 2010, Craig Venter produced the world’s first ‘synthetic organism’, dealing vitalism a final death blow in the process. Created from a bacterium with its nucleus removed, he inserted an entirely synthetic chromosome bearing DNA famously ‘watermarked’ with quotes from James Joyce and Richard Feynman. The cell promptly took on the identity written into its new genome, like a computer rebooted from a new hard disk.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Understandably, then, you might think that synthetic biology is in its youth. But while making entirely synthetic organisms is very new, genetic engineering definitely isn’t: from the first &lt;em>E. coli&lt;/em> cells ‘programmed’ with extra genes to produce human insulin in the late 1970s, tinkering with an organism’s DNA is a decades-old practice. What has changed is the ease and rapidity with which it can be done—Venter’s work, producing a whole genome artificially, being the most extreme example of what’s possible. iGEM, the International Genetically Engineered Machines competition, gives undergraduates a chance to try their hand at real, cutting-edge synthetic biology. Over the course of a few months, they will go from students to genetic engineers, working with other students to produce microorganisms which have never before existed in nature.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Every summer, teams of young bioscientists assemble and, under the guidance of professors at their respective universities, try to build a synthetic organism. They are required to draw from a central repository of BioBricks, genetic building blocks which can be chained together seamlessly in a genetic ‘circuit’ without reworking. Teams can also design their own BioBricks, adding them to the central repository for others to use. Teams present their work online as a wiki and as a presentation at the iGEM jamboree which takes place at MIT. Though there are a number of medals and prizes to be won, the Grand Prize Winner gets to take home the BioBrick trophy which, fittingly, is a large aluminium Lego brick.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A ten-strong team of University College London bioscientists spent their summer working long hours getting their genetically-engineered organism up and running. Though this is only the second time UCL has entered the competition (competing last year with a team of three), their creation is remarkable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Typically, bacterial cultures grown in fermenters have to be ‘induced’. They first divide again and again, growing exponentially, until their growth plateaus. At this stationary point, where cell growth and cell death are occurring at equal rates, an inducer is added to the mix and the gene of interest is expressed, producing the desired protein—whether that be human insulin or vegetarian rennet. Ensuring the inducer is added at the correct time requires constant monitoring of the culture’s density. The UCL team has developed a modified bacterium that self-induces—senses when the culture’s oxygen levels spike (signalling a plateau in growth) and begins protein production all by itself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They call it Hypoxon, and UCL’s Biochemical Engineering department thinks it could be a huge hit. Fermenters full of recombinant &lt;em>E. coli&lt;/em> are so common that the self-inducing bacteria could be used in thousands of different labs and plants around the world. More importantly, the system works: the team picked green fluorescent protein for their proof-of-concept and sure enough, as the Hypoxon culture reached the right growth stage, the cells started producing the protein and fluorescing under UV light.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The team’s co-operation with the University of Bristol team has already guaranteed them a gold medal at the jamboree, but winning the Grand Prize will be tough. A promising vaccine against stomach ulcers was a previous winner, and this year’s entries include a bacterium for rapid waterborne parasite detection, a project to alter mosquitoes’ gut flora to kill the malaria parasite and bacteria that would produce yoghurt rich in miraculin, a protein which binds to taste buds to temporarily make bitter foods taste sweet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From the first international competition in 2005, iGEM has grown from 13 to 128 teams. The final award ceremony is now too big to take place on campus; it will instead fill a Boston convention centre. Initially a cute demonstration of the potential of assembling a few genes to make bacteria produce pulses of light, the competition has become an annual maelstrom of innovation and boundary-pushing. And as teams and universities improve their skills, better solutions emerge from their labs, and MIT’s registry of BioBricks grows. The potential of synthetic biology is just beginning to be seen, and it’s young undergraduates who are pioneering some of its most interesting applications. Cut-and-paste biology is getting serious.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The approach usually taken to learning is to repeat. A good revision timetable will allow lots of time for reviewing material several times; a bad one will allow less time. With each repetition, each review of a list of bullet points or a slide in a lecture, you learn a little bit more, and the memory sticks a little better. A simple linear relationship between the number of repetitions and the amount remembered.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Except that memory works nothing like this. Linearly spaced repetitions are a poor way of memorising facts. Cramming works, for sure, but only to retain information for a brief period of time. And it’s true: the more you repeat material, the better you learn it. But what if you could invest that same amount of time spent cramming—or endlessly repeating—in a different way? What would be the most efficient way to learn?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Learning is best described in terms of forgetting. Plotting the chance of remembering a fact against time shows something interesting: it’s an exponential decay described as a ‘forgetting curve’, and it explains why even a couple of days after poring over a Latin vocabulary list you can piece together very little of it. The curve makes a rapid path downwards before levelling off. At first, memories fade very quickly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But every time you review material, not only do you reset your forgetting curve by bumping it back up but you move onto a new, shallower curve. Now you can easily recall reviewed facts for five or six days before they fade. Another repetition, a new forgetting curve. The trick is repeating those facts at the right interval—too early and repetition is ineffective; too late and the memories are already gone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is the system that Piotr Wozniak spent the last forty years refining. A Polish memory researcher, Wozniak was frustrated as an undergraduate that he and his fellow students seemed unable to improve their English beyond a clumsy pidgin. Starting from the premise that repeating facts aids in their memorisation, he spent hundreds of hours optimising the best spacing for learning English words and tracking the ease with which he could recall them. By the late 1980s his efforts had been met with failure, but he continued to adjust the spacing between repetitions, mostly on paper or with primitive punch-card programs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Years later, Wozniak eventually cracked the timing and developed a computer-based method for scheduling repetitions. His algorithm was the basis for his own program, &lt;em>SuperMemo&lt;/em>, and later repackaged into more elegant open-source equivalents—&lt;em>Anki&lt;/em> being one which remains the king of spaced repetition software.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You enter facts as question-answer pairs, whether a foreign word with its translation, an equation with a solution or a sentence with a fact missing. These pairs are the atomic unit of spaced repetition, and the less information they contain, the better your chance of learning them. You do a daily review, not usually longer than ten minutes, during which you are shown a question, try to recall the answer and then hit ‘show’ to see it. You grade your response; easy cards are scheduled for more distant repeats (they lie on shallower forgetting curves) and hard ones sooner (on steeper forgetting curves).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Digesting material into small question-answer pairs is an irritation, but as reviews are scheduled at increasing intervals determined automatically for each fact, you spend very little time actually reviewing each card. More accurately, you review each fact at the optimal time to strengthen its memory: just as you are about to forget it. The software knows which facts you are on the cusp of forgetting and gives you a prod at the right moment to bring them back to the front of your mind.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This phenomenon—that people learn much more efficiently and remember facts much better when they are spaced at increasing intervals rather than at linear intervals—is the &lt;em>spacing effect&lt;/em>. By scheduling your learning in this way you do the fewest possible repeats per item to keep it in your long-term memory. Because of the huge efficiency gain over conventional memorisation methods, Wozniak predicts that most people can learn, and remember forever, a few million such items in a lifetime. Naturally, he sticks to his learning regimen religiously.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course, spaced repetition is no magic bullet. Unstructured memorisation will never by itself teach you a language, nor will it get you through your degree. It’s not a replacement for teaching. The usual advice still stands: take good notes, review them often, take pains to understand material you didn’t get first time round. And at first, progress can be slower than conventional methods (you really are better off cramming for that test in a week’s time). But Wozniak’s discovery and the software that makes use of it can help with what many people, at all stages of life, find the most tedious part of learning: bulk memorisation of raw facts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By the sixth repeat, you now sit on a forgetting curve which projects years into the future. A further couple of reviews guarantees life-long remembering of that fact. Some would argue that they simply don’t want to remember everything they are taught, or don’t have time to break down their whole degree into individual facts. But Wozniak’s goal was never to tell people to remember everything they encounter or to digest whole textbooks into flashcards. With dedication, spaced repetition gives you the power to choose which memories to retain and which to allow to naturally atrophy. Those you do focus on you can remember for the rest of your life.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The pharmaceuticals industry has an obsession with novelty. We want better drugs with fewer side-effects, but too often &lt;em>newness&lt;/em> is correlated (wrongly) with an improvement in quality. One new drug that is twice as good at treating an illness as its predecessor is better than five drugs each offering a one per cent improvement on the first. ‘New’ drugs which appear on the market often seem to be derivatives of the well-tested substances which precede them and not genuinely novel drugs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Consider &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escitalopram">escitalopram&lt;/a>, a relatively new SSRI antidepressant. This is not a new drug in any meaningful way—rather, it is an enantiomerically pure form of the older, off-patent antidepressant citalopram. (In chemistry, a chemical’s connectivity—the order in which groups are bonded to one another—is referred to as its &lt;em>stereochemistry&lt;/em>, and chemicals can have different forms or _&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enantiomer">enantiomers&lt;/a> _as a result of these different ways of connecting the groups together.) Citalopram is a mixture of two enantiomers; isolate one and you’ve got escitalopram.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While escitalopram does seem to have better clinical efficacy at treating depression, it can’t really be said to be &lt;em>new&lt;/em> in the way that, say, fluoxetine (Prozac) was when it hit the market in the late 1980s. Fluoxetine was seen as revolutionary when it was introduced, but its efficacy—and that of its more modern siblings—is still only &lt;a href="http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pmed.0050045">barely better than placebo&lt;/a>. Is it possible that nothing better has come along in more than twenty years?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A number of other drugs—&lt;a href="http://www.amineptine.com/">amineptine&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tianeptine">tianeptine&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/npp/journal/v20/n3/full/1395258a.html">moclobemide&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://www.selegiline.com/">selegiline&lt;/a> among them—have shown great promise in treating depression and, may indeed be suitable for general mood enhancement. Amineptine was withdrawn from the market because of its slight stimulant effects, never to be manufactured again. (Surely a substance which could genuinely and consistently improve one’s mood would be addictive by definition?)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The other three drugs have been shown to be promising antidepressants and mood enhancers but there seems little interest in comparing their efficacy with that of fluoxetine, the &lt;em>de facto&lt;/em> treatment for depression in a number of countries. We are eager to test new drugs but no-one is willing to spend money testing ‘old’ drugs. Tianeptine isn’t even licenced for sale in the US, presumably because it is now off-patent and no company has any incentive to push for FDA approval.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yohimbine">Yohimbine&lt;/a> is another interesting drug which languishes in scientific obscurity. Potentially quite a useful aphrodisiac and treatment for erectile dysfunction, &lt;a href="http://www.biopsychiatry.com/yohimbine.html">this&lt;/a> study into its effectiveness asks why so little data on it is available, concluding that its off-patent status is a serious disincentive for further investigation into its clinical efficacy:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Despite such a long history and encouraging activity, the drug has not yet been subjected to scientifically rigid human clinical trials. … Recent studies have been designed with a lack of insight and complete disregard of those fundamental studies. … Dose-response investigations are not available, alternative routes of administration have not been investigated… Synergistic activity with other drugs was last studied nearly four decades ago. Assessments of various populations were carried out in very limited cohorts and only in the most general terms. …&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yohimbine is an old drug. As such it does not enjoy patent protection or commercial viability. Until molecular/formulation changes can be brought about … serious investigation of the drug will remain in limbo.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>If big pharma isn’t going to look into vintage pharmacotherapies, shouldn’t governments be willing to do so? If the purpose of bodies like &lt;a href="http://www.nice.org.uk/">NICE&lt;/a> is to find the most effective treatment at the lowest cost, don’t they have an incentive to investigate other drugs; to scour the literature for candidate substances and fund studies of drugs which showed promise but were left languishing?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The immortality brigade</title><link>https://henrystanley.com/the-immortality-brigade/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Nov 2009 17:43:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://henrystanley.com/the-immortality-brigade/</guid><description>
&lt;p>A fifty-seat room was never going to be big enough. People fill the aisles, sit on the ground and peer around the door. A man comes in a little late clutching a box bearing the &lt;em>LifeExtension&lt;/em> ‘nutriceutical’ brand. Sunlight glints through the windows, dappling the trademark grey-speckled beard and ponytail of today’s speaker, the somewhat notorious Aubrey de Grey. For the next two hours, this room will house discussions of whole-brain emulation, ‘strong’ (self-improving) artificial intelligence and molecular medicine’s promise of immortality. For the moment, this was a room of Singularitarians.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The precise definition of the Singularity depends on who you ask, but popular variations usually involve the principle of exponentially accelerating returns in technology, invoking Moore’s law which states that transistor density, and hence computer speed, doubles every eighteen months. We quickly end up on the nearly vertical slope of the exponential curve, with colossal advances occurring near-instantaneously. At present, we can adapt to new technologies like the internet because they progress relatively slowly. If the scale and pace of modern research caused such advances came much more quickly, humans might have trouble keeping up with the cutting edge.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Consider what might happen if we were able to significantly augment human intelligence with machines. We would then be able to use our newfound intellect to build better machines, which would further improve us, allowing us to further improve on them… A point of explosive exponential increase.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Quite what a post-Singularity world will look like is impossible to say, but the potential payoffs are large: the end of ageing, the ability to augment, back up and restore one’s brain, collective consciousness and a life of leisure enabled by the advent of strong AI are a few of the benefits touted by advocates.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most striking is the apparent inevitability the advance of computing technology: since its inception in 1965, Moore’s law has held unwaveringly. It presumably has some physical limit above which further improvements are not possible. Some predict that it may not last more than five or ten years more. Of course, such prophesies have been made for the last thirty years, and still processing power grows apparently unabated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s de Grey’s turn to speak. His appearance is no less striking than his talk: he wears a loose, lime-green check shirt, sleeves rolled up, and sports a ponytail and bushy beard that comes down practically to his navel. He resembles a biblical prophet working dress-down Friday at an internet startup. de Grey’s organisation—Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence, or SENS—promotes the development of techniques that can maintain and repair the ageing body.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“When this does become a possibility,” de Grey explains, “no government will fail to deliver this technology universally as the cost of maintaining an ageing population is so vast. And when the prospect of immortality is on the cards for all of us, perhaps we’ll take other existential risks—climate change among them—more seriously.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Strikingly, de Grey presents a model showing that the quality of molecular medicine need only double once every forty-two years to allow those alive today to live forever with sufficient regenerative treatments. “For fuck’s sake,” he exclaims, “that’s the time it took to go from the Hindenberg to Concorde.” Murmurs of approval from the audience, though his talk contains a dispiriting vacuum of information on how sophisticated our abilities currently are or whether any projects in the pipeline are keeping us on track for the goal of immortality within our lifetime.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The debate in the room quickly turns intense, with a gamut of views expressed and discussed. Unsurprisingly, a meeting such as this tends to involve detailed discourse on the vagaries of developing AI or of whole-brain emulation, rather than on the basic feasibility of the Singularity. de Grey expressed his own, rather serious, doubts: a key necessity is the ability for an artificially intelligent machine to recursively improve upon its own intelligence, but de Grey suggested that there might be a mathematical upper limit to the rate of this improvement. Beyond this, though, there is little more than superficial discussion of how likely the Singularity is to come to pass, which for a field as apparently fantastical and potentially revolutionary as this is disappointing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even de Grey’s speech on ending ageing went mostly unchallenged, despite the implications his work could have. Many contemporary philosophers, transhumanist Nick Bostrom among them, have opined on the ways in which engineered immortality would radically change the way society operates, but de Grey himself is oddly silent on the matter. This seems surprising—public opinion of Singularitarians seems to be generally apathetic or negative, with the Singularity painted as a ‘geek religion’ of sorts, and views on ending ageing are even less accepting, so those espousing post-human viewpoints need to make the moral case for their convictions. In this room in Birkbeck, though, de Grey is probably preaching to the converted.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The term ‘Singularity’ is likely to see frequent use among technojournalists in search of an impressive but baseless story in the years between now and whenever the Singularity actually comes to pass. An important point is that some of the technological advances promised are very feasible and almost inevitably are right outside the door. Public discussion of the ethical quandries invented along with smart drugs or personal genome sequencing is important if we are to avoid these innovations causing damage rather than good due to imprudent or unscrupulous use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a brief adjournment to the Marlborough Arms, the Singularitarians disperse into Bloomsbury. de Grey cycles off to get a train back to Cambridge, beard flowing behind him. For a man who plans to live forever, it’s a little surprising he doesn’t wear a helmet.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;em>I was given the task of writing a piece on the primary school science club I help run which is to appear in UCL’s Volunteering Services Unit (VSU) annual review as a showcase of the work the Unit funds. This is what I came up with—comments and suggestions are much appreciated.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The scant paragraph in the VSU’s weekly email asked simply for ‘two or three enthusiastic scientists to assist with running a school science club’. Not wanting to turn down an opportunity to affirm our scientific prowess, four volunteers-to-be enlisted and met for coffees in the Bloomsbury Café opposite the monolithic facade of the Chemistry building.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Under the wing of Dr Andrea Sella, UCL Chemistry lecturer and demonstrator extraordinaire, we set about planning a series of hour-long sessions suitable for the seven- to eleven-year-olds we would eventually be working with. Never short of innovation, UCL’s online learning environment became the electronic home of the Gillespie Science Club as we worked to collaborate on designing sessions and assemble a rota for the four of us, scheduling two people per session while ensuring that everyone was worked evenly as their respective schedules allowed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The sessions themselves had a central theme—demonstrating the properties of dry ice, making glow-in-the-dark jelly, simulating a scale meteor strike; the usual—and involved giving a brief presentation on what we would be doing and then moving our aspiring young seekers of knowledge to a demo area where we performed our experiment, either a demonstration if dangerous substances were involved or in small groups in which they could each have a go.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first few sessions went fairly smoothly, though for most of us it was the first time we’d worked with children and our charges’ capacity for belligerence (of the most endearing and inquisitive kind) did, at times, seem unending. After a time, however, something remarkable happened: we started to get comments from parents, some of whom had never before heard of the science club, expressing their admiration for our work. We had, it seemed, gained a reputation as bringers of empiricism—and of fun.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We had not only become men and women of some repute in the primary school community (with Dr Sella, the man behind the scenes, being nothing short of a celebrity) but we gradually learned how best to capture the attention of the students and keep them engaged while developing in them the skills needed of future scientists, and indeed of future non-scientists if they are to fully understand the world around them. Long-winded presentations were a no-no, but any opportunity for the kids to show off their knowledge was lapped up. Some children were louder than others, but with some effort we worked to ensure the quieter ones were heard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One thing that every one of us noticed and was astounded by was the children’s curiosity. Almost all of our tutees asked lots of questions, some of them very astute, and we did our best to encourage it. Most people, it seems, learn to suppress this curiosity for one reason or another. With luck, there will be ten boys and girls out there who continue to ask questions of their teachers and superiors, and never stop doing so. See if you can spot them.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hello, world.</title><link>https://henrystanley.com/hello-world./</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jul 2009 09:28:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://henrystanley.com/hello-world./</guid><description>
&lt;p>So, here it is. The very first in what will hopefully become a long line of posts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ultimately, I want this to become a corner of the internet I can call my own—part stream of consciousness, part formal essays. The idea that this domain has been unused for years surprises me a little when I think of it, as I classically enjoyed tinkering with my website and showing off my work. Some &lt;em>frisson&lt;/em> of self-consciousness must have brought an end to that as it has most of my online projects, but here I am again, come full circle, with a website once more—hopefully a little more refined than the hand-codings of a thirteen-year-old—and with it a new-found &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/henryaj">online presence&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a few hours’ time this post will be indexed and cached by Google and the Internet Archive, a fossilised carbon copy of this tract. To some that immortality might be reason alone to publish; to me it’s a reason not to. But then, &lt;a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/sound-young-america/maxfuncon-merlin-mann-doing-creative-work-sound-young-america">everyone is afraid of sucking&lt;/a>. And everyone is afraid of starting. So let’s begin.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
