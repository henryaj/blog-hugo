<p>Today is <a href=https://thedaywefightback.org/international/>The Day We Fight Back</a>. Sign the petition, and join the movement against mass surveillance programmes. <a href=https://www.eff.org/about/staff/danny-obrien-0>Danny O&rsquo;Brien</a>, International Director at the EFF, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7217164">explains in more detail</a> what the petition <a href=https://necessaryandproportionate.net/>is in support of</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The short answer is that you&rsquo;re signing your support for a set of 13 principles on the application of human rights to communications surveillance ( see <a href=https://necessaryandproportionate.net/>https://necessaryandproportionate.net/</a> ), that were worked out last year (pre-Snowden, actually) by a coalition of technologists, privacy activists, and legal scholars &mldr; to push the idea in international venues and among key lawmakers in various countries that mass surveillance (as well as a bunch of other practices conducted by the NSA and other spooks, including corruption of crypto standards and backdoors) is a violation of existing human rights standards. This is important internationally because if the NSA gets away with its current behaviour, it&rsquo;ll establish a norm that such surveillance is okay for any government to conduct. We need to push back against that norm. &mldr; I&rsquo;d encourage anyone who wants to understand better how we&rsquo;re trying to get all governments, not just the US, to craft better surveillance legislation to read the full text of the principles at <a href=https://necessaryandproportionate.net/text>https://necessaryandproportionate.net/text</a> You can also ask me questions at <a href=mailto:danny@eff.org>danny@eff.org</a> . It&rsquo;s a long haul project, and we&rsquo;re conducting it alongside legal actions in the US and abroad, shoring up and disseminating crypto tools, and other non-policy defences. But it&rsquo;s pretty amazing to get unanimity with hundreds of privacy groups on some basic principles with which to start building proper, 21st century, surveillance law.</p>
