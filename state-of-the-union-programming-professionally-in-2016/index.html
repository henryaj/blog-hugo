<p>Stack Overflow released their latest <a href=http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016>annual developer survey</a> last month. (For any non-programmers reading: Stack Overflow is a website where you can ask questions about programming. For many programming problems, the answer will already be up there. It&rsquo;s an amazing resource that almost everyone in the industry uses.) A few key points stood out for me.</p>
<p><strong><a href=http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016#developer-profile-education>Education</a>: 43% of programmers have a BA or BS in Computer Science or a related field.</strong> This is a much smaller number than I would have guessed. It&rsquo;s amazing to think that most programmers don&rsquo;t have a CS degree. The survey methodology has changed from last year, when respondents could only pick one option for their education, Maybe I shouldn&rsquo;t be so surprised. During a recent retrospective at Pivotal, I noted that of the handful of people in the room, most either had a degree in a non-CS subject or didn&rsquo;t have a degree at all.</p>
<p><strong><a href=https://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016#developer-profile-education>Bootcamp graduates</a>: 6.5% of developers with over five years' experience have taken a full-time intensive programming course</strong> – that&rsquo;s over 1 in 20, more than I expected. It suggests that bootcamp alumni are finding their feet as professional developers, and shouldn&rsquo;t have problems getting jobs as long as their skills stay relevant. <a href=https://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016#salary-per-education>Bootcamp graduates' salaries are 20% above average</a> – a similar uplift to having a CS PhD.</p>
<p><strong><a href=http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016#salary-gender>Salary by gender</a>: there&rsquo;s no gender pay gap for young developers in the US – but there&rsquo;s a significant pay gap for those above 30.</strong> The effect is smaller, but still significant, when comparing by years of experience instead of age.</p>
<p><strong><a href=https://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016#female-developers-age>Gender balance by age</a>: women make up much more of the youngest and oldest age groups than those in the middle.</strong> The peak in the over-60 age group certainly corresponds to the 1980s peak – and subsequent collapse – in <a href=http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2014/10/21/357629765/when-women-stopped-coding>the number of women taking CS degrees</a>, and when those women would have entered the workforce. Perhaps we&rsquo;re seeing an uptick in the number of women entering the industry.</p>
<p><strong><a href=https://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016#most-popular-technologies-per-occupation>The stack</a>: JavaScript is the most used technology by front-end, back-end and full-stack developers.</strong> Wat.</p>
